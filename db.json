    "text": "Firms should consider creating green supply chains rather than following a few environmental practices\n\nThe United Nations Millennium Development Goals and the World Bank Group\u2019s global practices have recognised sustainability as an essential issue of global importance. Economic, social and other forms of sustainability have evolved over the years, but it is environmental sustainability that has gained significant popularity.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability is understood as buying greener products, avoiding hazardous materials, energy optimisation, and waste reduction. While some firms are still reluctant to engage in environmentally beneficial activities as they are afraid to compromise on the economic benefits, some others have positioned environmental practices at the forefront due to legislation, and industry and government commitments. In several firms, high importance has been given to environmentalism due to compelling regulatory norms, and a potential to manage costs, risks and optimise eco-friendly practices. However, in this process, organisations, especially in the manufacturing sector, get so serious about the low-hanging fruits of waste reduction and energy efficiency improvements that they fail to recognise the need for restructuring their learning imperatives and see the big picture of environmentalism. While government norms, organisational policies and corporate environmental responsibility projects drive environment-friendly practices, these are merely short-term actions towards environmental sustainability.\n\nAlso read | Sand, a global sustainability challenge: UN report\n\nLong-lasting benefits\n\nOnly through organisational learning can people be urged to work towards long-lasting benefits. In this context, green supply chain practices are useful. These include green procurement, green manufacturing, green distribution, and reverse logistics. With practices starting from acquisition of eco-friendly raw material to disposal/ reuse/ recycle of used products,employees, suppliers, distributors, retailers and customers will be able to integrate environmental concerns in the daily operations of a firm. Thus, green supply chain practices enable organisational learning in environmental sustainability.\n\nOur research, based on a survey of 220 respondents across 21 manufacturing units in India, points to the inter-linkages between green supply chain practices, organisational performance and learning. We found that these inter-linkages not only lead to a long-lasting natural drive towards environmental performance, but also to higher economic performance . Research shows that the positive impacts of environmentalism can only be felt in the long term when they get embedded into organisational learning systems through green supply chain practices. The resultant learning system smoothens the knowledge flow in the organisation and help firms to strategise for better performance, bearing in mind the environmental aspects. This further promotes environmentalism across all players in manufacturing supply chains. Thus, environmental sustainability is ensured from the source (willingness) and not through force (regulations).\n\nOpinion | No, the lockdown is not a green moment\n\nUnderstanding links\n\nDrawing linkages between green supply chain practices, corporate environmental performance, corporate economic performance and the dimensions of learning organisations in firms is necessary for an organisation\u2019s progress and environmental protection in society. Understanding these inevitable links will enable managers and experts to shape their organisational values, work practices, and performances for the greater good of society.\n\nWe infer that when the different players of a manufacturing supply chain realise the inherent benefits associated with organisational learning dimensions, their drive towards environmentalism increases. Policymakers should support this thinking by not merely imposing environmental practices as regulatory norms but by emphasising on the creation of green supply chain-based learning systems in manufacturing.\n\nVijaya Sunder M. is Assistant Professor of Practice in Operations Management at the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad",

But can they be places of harm as well? The world over, one in 10 patients experiences or is subject to harm in health-care settings. These range from operations done on the wrong patient, to injections being administered in an unsafe manner. Studies in India have shown that more than two-thirds of injections are given in an unsafe manner; equally worrying is the fact that over two-thirds of injections in primary care are unnecessary in the first place.\n\nGlobal focus\n\nTo highlight this important issue, the World Health Organization observes World Patient Safety Day every year (September 17). The theme for 2020 was \u2018Health Worker Safety: A Priority for Patient Safety\u2019 with a call to action to \u2018Speak up for health worker safety!\u2019 But one may wonder, why, on a day dedicated for patient safety, we should speak up for health worker safety? So, why is health worker safety important for patient safety?\n\nEditorial | Protection for protectors: On safety of healthcare workers\n\nMuch harm done to patients in health-care settings is because of unsafe health-care practice and unsafe health-care communication. Unsafe health-care practice refers to unsafe or unnecessary procedures, wrong medications, medications given in a wrong dosage, etc. Unsafe health-care communication refers to mistakes made in health-care settings due to miscommunication between health professionals, for example, during patient handover in between staff shifts. The quality of both practice and communication is dependent on the safety and well-being of health workers. For example, numerous studies have shown that health workers, such as residents, who have been on duty for more than 24 hours at a stretch, have a higher risk of making mistakes, increasing the likelihood of a direct impact on patient safety.\n\nCOVID-19 and reporting cases\n\nDuring the current COVID-19 crisis, health workers are not only putting in longer hours but also working under increasingly difficult circumstances, which affect both their physical and mental health. The mental health of health workers is linked to the workplace culture. Some organisations have a culture of supporting staff, responding to their needs and encouraging learning from mistakes; while others have a culture of fault-finding, blame, guilt and abuse. When instances of patient harm occur, whether people feel encouraged to report them, depends on the organisation\u2019s culture and leadership.\n\nWithout reporting, it is difficult for organisations to learn from mistakes and create systems, such as check lists in order to prevent similar future occurrences. In addition, in India, it is not uncommon to find health-care organisations observe strict hierarchies between specialties, between designations, and between doctors and other health professionals, such as nurses. Such power differences can further prevent reporting and cooperative organisational learning and may, in fact, increase chances of abuse: verbal, physical, emotional and sexual, putting the safety of health workers and patients at risk.\n\nAlso read | In Chennai, doctor\u2019s burial marred by protests, attacks\n\nLooking at the organisation\n\nOrganisational learning is more important than individual learning. This is because instances of patient harm, even when they occur at the individual level, are often an end result of a chain of organisational failures.\n\nFor example, systemic under staffing, lack of reporting mechanisms, lack of dedicated time for hand overs, audits, training and team building, poorly maintained equipment and corruption in purchases, are all organisational failures that could result in a cascade leading to avoidable harm to the patient. Moreover, good systems can mitigate the effects of individual mistakes.\n\nThus, it is pertinent to look beyond the individual to look at the organisation as the sum of multiple elements that interact with each other. This involves taking a systems approach. What does that involve? Let us take the example of overcrowding. In many hospitals, quality of care is often compromised because of overcrowding, such as in the emergency department. To take a systems approach in this situation would mean looking at it holistically \u2014 for example, from at least three angles using the input-throughput-output conceptual model described by Asplin et al in the Annals of Emergency Medicine in 2003.\n\nEditorial | Do no harm: on safety of health care workers\n\nOne, the input: looking at whether patients who come to the emergency department need to be there in the first place or could be managed somewhere else such as in the community itself. Two, the throughput: looking at whether there are inefficiencies such as shortage of doctors, nurses, equipment or space that is increasing the time taken for patients to be treated. And three, the output: looking at whether the patients are staying longer in the emergency department than required because of lack of non-emergency department inpatient beds, delays at the pharmacy or delays in transportation of patients out of the emergency department.\n\nThe conversation on health during COVID-19 has often centred on individuals, with certain individuals, such as health-care workers, seen as heroes, and others (including those referred to as \u2018super spreaders\u2019 in a stigmatising way), seen as villains. Many health workers have demonstrated excellence despite the limitations in the Indian health system. This is laudable but may not be sustainable. Creating sustainability would involve taking a systems approach to make sure all parts of the system, both of health care and of supportive social care are well functioning.\n\nAlso read | Why health care workers above 60 should be \u2018benched\u2019\n\nMany health workers are overworked not by choice, but rather the lack of it since understaffing and shortages are a common feature of the Indian public health-care system. In addition, India simply does not have enough health facilities to cater to all its population, even without a pandemic. Further, the lack of adequate social care, such as care homes, community health services and community-based rehabilitative and palliative services, unduly increase the burden on health-care facilities.\n\nStakeholder involvement\n\nFinally, a systems approach involves all stakeholders. Patients themselves need to be aware of patient safety as well as be empowered to demand safe health care and resist unnecessary medications and procedures. Hospital managers must understand the need for and be empowered to create systems of reporting, monitoring and organisational learning. Policy makers must prioritise staffing, co-designing functional and safe workplaces, and ethics in health care.\n\nAlso read | ASHA workers soldier on \u2014 unprotected and poorly paid\n\nNumerous persons find healing and restoration in health care. But some are harmed as well. In crises such as COVID-19, quality of care can be compromised further. We can help improve patient safety by taking a systems approach and promoting a culture of health worker safety and well-being.\n\nDr. Harikeerthan Raghuram is a public health researcher and consultant.

But Mr. Yin said that could change.\n\nSinoVac is developing one of China\u2019s top four vaccine candidates along with state-owned SinoPharm, which has two in development, and military-affiliated private firm CanSino.\n\nMore than 24,000 people are participating in clinical trials of CoronaVac in Brazil, Turkey, and Indonesia, with additional trials scheduled for Bangladesh and possibly Chile, Mr. Yin said. SinoVac chose those countries because they all had serious outbreaks, large populations and limited research and development capacity, he said.\n\nSinoVac is also starting to test small doses of CoronaVac on children and the elderly in China after noticing rising numbers of cases globally among those two groups.\n\nMr. Yin said the company would prioritise distribution of the vaccine to countries hosting human trials of CoronaVac.\n\nWhile the vaccine has not yet passed the phase 3 clinical trials, a globally accepted standard, SinoVac has already injected thousands of people in China under an emergency use provision.\n\nMr. Yin said he was one of the first to receive the experimental vaccine months ago along with researchers after phase one and two of human trials showed no serious adverse effects. He said that self-injecting showed his support for CoronaVac.\n\n\u201cThis is kind of a tradition of our company,\u201d Mr. Yin said, adding that he had done the same with a hepatitis vaccine under development.\n\nEarlier this year, China permitted \u201cemergency use\u201d of vaccine candidates for at-risk populations like border personnel and medical workers if companies could show \u201cgood safety and good antibodies\u201d from tests of about 1,000 people, Mr. Yin said.\n\nSinoVac received that approval in June along with SinoPharm and CanSino, and was able to provide tens of thousands of doses of CoronaVac to Beijing\u2019s municipal government, Mr. Yin said.\n\nSinoVac employees qualified for emergency use of the vaccine because an outbreak inside the company would cripple its ability to develop a vaccine, he said. About 90% of the company\u2019s staff have received it.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that our research of the COVI-19 vaccines can meet the standards of the U.S. and EU countries,\u201d Mr. Yin said.",

    "text": "Military-level talks help avoid confrontation, but the China border remains a challenge\n\nThat India and China have agreed to stop sending more troops to the frontline is a welcome step towards hitting pause on the rising tensions along the LAC. Indeed, the genesis of the tensions lies in China\u2019s large-scale deployment of troops to forward areas in May, and subsequent multiple transgressions in the Galwan Valley, Pangong Lake, Gogra, Hot Springs, and Depsang plains that have violated almost every core tenet of the four border agreements that have helped keep the peace since 1993. This has forced India to match the Chinese deployment, leading to an extraordinary build-up on a scale not seen since 1962. The new agreement of September 21, at the sixth round of Corps Commander talks since June, will put a stop to this build-up, that is, if it is implemented sincerely. The joint press release said the sides had agreed to strengthen communication on the ground, avoid misjudgments, and to refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground, besides holding a next round at an early date, underlining that many issues remain unresolved.\n\nIf this agreement can potentially help stem the bleeding as it were, it does not address most of India\u2019s fundamental concerns on the LAC. Prior to the talks, Indian officials had highlighted the key points of their agenda as having China withdraw from all friction points including Depsang and Pangong Tso and granting unhindered access to all patrolling points (PPs) \u2014 China has blocked access to 10 PPs since May. The joint press release makes no mention of restoration of the status quo ante of April, only referring to no unilateral changes to the ground situation, which refers to the current status quo. It is true that one or two rounds of talks cannot be expected realistically to resolve a situation that is, in many ways, even more complex than the 1986 Sumdorong Chu stand-off \u2014 and that took six years before the status quo was restored. At the same time, a second joint public statement in as many weeks is a positive development in itself, showing both have the intent to stabilise the situation, even if their motivations may be different. For the Indian government, such a statement in the midst of a Parliament session where it has faced questions over its handling of the LAC situation sends the message that the China crisis is under control. For China, the motivations could be two-fold \u2014 either a tactical pause that gives it time to prepare for further military manoeuvres, as was the case in end-August south of Pangong Lake, or a signal that Beijing wants to dial down tensions, albeit on its own terms and most likely without giving up the territorial gains it has made since May. Whichever may be the case, the reality for Delhi is that the challenge along the LAC may be far from over.",

    "text": "Rio de Janeiro delayed its annual Carnival parade, saying Thursday night that the global spectacle cannot go ahead in February because of Brazil\u2019s continued vulnerability to the pandemic.\n\nRio\u2019s League of Samba Schools, LIESA, announced that the spread of the coronavirus has made it impossible to safely hold the traditional parades that are a cultural mainstay and, for many, a source of livelihood.\n\n\u201cCarnival is a party upon which many humble workers depend. The samba schools are community institutions, and the parades are just one detail of all that,\u201d said Luiz Antonio Simas, a historian who specialises in Rio\u2019s Carnival. \u201cAn entire cultural and productive chain was disrupted by COVID.\u201d\n\nRio\u2019s City Hall has yet to announce a decision about the Carnival street parties that also take place across the city. But its tourism promotion agency said in a statement on September 17 that without a coronavirus vaccine, it is uncertain when large public events can resume.\n\nA full year\n\nBrazil\u2019s first confirmed coronavirus case was February 26, one day after this year\u2019s Carnival ended. As the number of infections grew, the samba schools that participate in the glitzy annual parade halted preparations for the 2021 event. Thursday\u2019s announcement removed the cloud of uncertainty that has hung over the city \u2014 one of worst hit by the pandemic in Brazil.\n\nNearly all of Rio\u2019s samba schools are closely linked to working class communities. Their processions include elaborate floats accompanied by tireless drummers and costumed dancers who sing at the top of their lungs to impress a panel of judges. Tens of thousands of spectators pack the bleachers of the arena, known as the Sambadrome, while tens of millions watch on television.\n\nBefore the schools began competing in the 1930s, Carnival was celebrated in dance halls and haphazardly on the streets, Mr. Simas said. The parades entered the Sambadrome in the 1980s, and have become Rio\u2019s quintessential Carnival display.\n\nThe immense labour required for each show was already stymied by restrictions on gatherings that Rio\u2019s governor imposed in March. Even with those measures, Rio\u2019s metropolitan region, home to 13 million people, so far has recorded more than 15,000 deaths from COVID-19.\n\nBeneath the Sambadrome\u2019s bleachers, the city created a homeless shelter for the vulnerable population during the pandemic.\n\nSamba schools suspended float construction, costume sewing, dance rehearsals, and also social projects. The Mangueira school\u2019s program in the favela near downtown Rio that teaches music to children \u2014 keeping them away from crime, and cultivating the school\u2019s future drummers \u2014 hasn\u2019t held classes since March.\n\nThe pulse of entire suburban Rio cities like Nilopolis, whose population of 1,60,000 cheers the Beija-Flor samba school, has faded, Mr. Simas said.\n\nSome performers resorted to odd jobs and gigs. Diogo Jesus, the lead dancer referred to as \u201cmaster of ceremonies\u201d in the Mocidade school, couldn\u2019t make rent without his income from private events. He started driving for Uber and sewing facemasks to sell at a fair.\n\n\u201cIt was a blow. We live Carnival all year round, and many people when they realized everything would stop wound up getting sick or depressed,\u201d Mr. Jesus said in an interview inside his house in Madureira, a neighborhood in northern Rio. \u201cCarnival is our life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must await the coming months for definition about if there will be a vaccine or not, and when there will be immunisation,\u201d LIESA\u2019s Castanheira told reporters in Rio on Thursday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the safety conditions to set a date.\u201d\n\nOnly precedent\n\nThe last year Rio\u2019s Carnival was suspended was 1912, following the death of the foreign relations minister. The mayor of Rio, at the time Brazil\u2019s capital, postponed by two months all licenses for the popular dance associations\u2019 Carnival parties, according to Lu\u00eds Cl\u00e1udio Villafa\u00f1e, a diplomat and author of the book The Day They Delayed Carnival. The mayor also voiced opposition to unregulated celebrations, but many Rio residents partied in the streets anyway.\n\nRevellers were undeterred during World War II. And they poured into the street every year during more than two decades of military dictatorship, until 1985, with government censors reviewing costumes, floats and song lyrics.\n\nThe 2020 coronavirus already forced Rio\u2019s City Hall to scrap traditional plans for its second-biggest party, New Year\u2019s Eve, which draws millions of people to Copacabana beach for dazzling fireworks. Earlier this month, the city\u2019s tourism promotion agency Riotur announced that main tourist spots will instead display light and music shows to be broadcast over the internet.\n\nDelay of the Carnival parade will deprive Rio state of much needed tourism revenue. In 2020, Carnival drew 2.1 million visitors and generated 4 billion reais ($725 million) in economic activity, according to Riotur. A statement from the agency Thursday provided no further clarity on the fate of the Carnival street parties.\n\nSome parties are small \u2014 for example one including a few dozen dog owners exhibiting their pets wearing wigs or funny hats. But most feature amps blasting music to throngs of thousands who dance, kiss and swill booze in a crush of celebration. The biggest one boasts more than two million party-goers.\n\nRita Fernandes, president of Os Blocos da Sebastiana, said her association already cancelled its 11 street parties that together draw 1.5 million revelers. Most others groups will follow, she said.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be irresponsible and bring the multitudes to the street,\u201d she said, pointing to Europe\u2019s second wave of contagion.\n\nAfter several weeks of declining daily infections, Rio authorities have begun expressing concern about an uptick. Public spaces such as beaches have been crowded in violation of pandemic restrictions.\n\nA drummer in Mangueira\u2019s samba school, Laudo Braz Neto, said the children he instructed before the pandemic are listless, and he knows there is no way to put on Carnival without being able to safely gather.\n\n\u201cCarnival will only really happen when the whole world can travel. It\u2019s a spectacle the world watches, brings income and movement here,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no hope for 2021.\u201d",

Maybe if we restricted them to 180 we wouldn\u2019t have been under pressure from ball one of the chase,\u201d said Kohli at the post-match presentation.\n\nKXIP posted 206 for three and RCB were bundled out for 109 in 17 overs.\n\n\u201cWe know exactly where we went wrong and I have to put my hand up and say a couple of important chances went down. There are days when these kind of things happen on the cricket field, they happen and we have to accept them.\n\n\u201cWe have had a good game (against Sunrisers Hyderabad), we have had a bad game and now it is time to move on and learn from the mistakes we made,\u201d said Kohli.\n\nOn sending the young Josh Philippe ahead of himself at number 3, Kohli said: \u201cHe has batted at the top of the order for Western Australia and done well in the BBL as well, early days in the tournament so we thought we will maximise his ability and see how we go from there on.

Rules are actually your friends as long as you understand them; they inform you how you can win. But sometimes people who are desperate to win tend to want to obscure the rules and make them seem complex so that you don\u2019t understand them. This makes rules seem intimidating and, therefore, have a force of their own. This forcefulness can at times make fools of us by diverting us from clearly perceiving the rule\u2019s actual import, which would be obvious \u2014 limpid, even \u2014 to us when we are at leisure and perceiving freely without being under the pressure of a force.\n\nPoint being, if you ever need to work out a problem to save your life, try to ignore the life-or-death pressure of survival. Just clear your mind, and try to be at leisure. Because that is possibly the best and only way you may be able to solve the problem and thereby save your life.\n\nThe Hindu Cryptic #13049 | 13 Across CLUE: Question a rising traitor in an Arabian land (5) Clue types : Abbreviation, reversal Definition : an Arabian land Answer : QATAR Clue explained: This one has an interesting thing going on. We need a 5-letter word that means \u2018an Arabian land\u2019. It involves Q (an abbreviation for \u2018question\u2019), the given letter A, and TAR, which is a reversal (as indicated by \u2018rising\u2019) of rat (another word for \u2018traitor\u2019). Q + A + TAR spells QATAR, which is definitely and obviously \u2018an Arabian land\u2019. If the synonym for \u2018traitor\u2019 had had to be anagrammed (i.e. its letters reshuffled in any order), that would have been illegal as per cryptic crossword laws. It would have been an Indirect Anagram, which is not kosher, because an IA essentially requires you to think of a synonym and then, because an anagram involves letters in any possible order, an entirely new word. Which would not be fair. Because each cryptic device should either a). point to the answer directly or b). point to an obvious way to get to the answer. In this case, however, we are dealing with a reversal and not an anagram of TAR. Which, as per condition \u2018b)\u2019 points to an obvious way to get to the answer \u2014 reversing the order of the letters.\n\nWas that fun to solve?

However, unlike similar occasions in the past, neither side walked out during the events held via video-conference on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking at the South Asian meeting, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar called on all SAARC members to \u201ccollectively resolve to defeat the scourge of terrorism, including the forces that nurture, support and encourage an environment of terror and conflict, which impede the objective of SAARC to realise its full potential for collective collaboration and prosperity across South Asia\u201d, without a direct reference to Pakistan.\n\n75th U.N. anniversary | India counters Pakistan\u2019s J&K references\n\nVeiled reference to J&K\n\nPakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who also attended the meet along with the Foreign Ministers of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka, used the SAARC platform to make a detailed statement on the resolution of \u201clong-standing disputes\u201d, a veiled reference to Jammu and Kashmir and New Delhi\u2019s 2019 move to withdraw Article 370.\n\n\u2018Unilateral moves\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Foreign Minister said we must condemn, oppose any unilateral and illegal measures to change the status of disputed territories in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions,\u201d the official Pakistan news agencies reported.\n\nThe reports said Mr. Qureshi also referred to \u201csystematic human rights violations of the people suffering from long-running disputes\u201d.\n\nA similar statement was made at the CICA Special Ministerial conference, that brings together Asian nations ranging from Russia and Central Asia to the Gulf and South-East Asia.\n\nIndia rebutted Mr. Qureshi in its right to reply, said the MEA. \u201cWe advise Pakistan to cease its sponsorship and overt and covert support to terrorism against India,\u201d India said.\n\nMEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said Pakistan\u2019s statements at both events were \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the mandates of SAARC and CICA, where bilateral contentious issues are not raised. \u201cWhat else can be expected of a country that indulges in cross-border terrorism as a part of its state policy,\u201d Mr. Srivastava added.\n\nLast week, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval had walked off from a virtual meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) after his Pakistani counterpart appeared with a Pakistani version of its map that included Indian territories. Last year, at the SAARC Foreign Minister\u2019s meeting held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Jaishankar and Mr. Qureshi had boycotted each other\u2019s speeches.\n\nPM Modi had also refused to attend the 19th edition of the SAARC summit, due to be held in Islamabad in 2016, over the issue of Pakistan\u2019s continued support to terror groups.\n\nSpeaking at the SAARC FM meet, however, Nepal\u2019s Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali and Nepal\u2019s Foreign Secretary Shanker Das Bairagi both said it is \u201cimperative\u201d to hold the SAARC summit.\n\n\u201cThe delay in convening the 19th SAARC Summit and the absence of formal meetings of the SAARC Charter bodies since 2016, has greatly impacted the functioning of our organisation,\u201d said Mr. Gyawali, adding that this \u201chas raised a serious question about the relevancy\u201d of SAARC.\n\nHowever, sources said \u201cmost countries\u201d agreed it is not the \u201copportune time\u201d to convene the summit as proposed by Pakistan, given the COVID-19 situation, and the proposal \u201cfell through\u201d.\n\nAll SAARC nations including India and Pakistan, however, built a common stand on the need to cooperate in battling the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Jaishankar listed a number of measures taken by India in the past few months including the SAARC Leaders video-conference convened by Mr. Modi, a \u2018COVID-19 Information Exchange Platform (COINEX), a SAARC Food Bank mechanism, as well as the SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund, to which India has contributed $10 million, making essential drugs, COVID protection and testing kits, amounting to $ 2.3 million available to countries in the SAARC region.",

    "text": "NGOs fill in for the state; regulations should not stifle their functioning\n\nAmendments to the FCRA, drafted without consultation with stakeholders and passed with limited discussion in Parliament, further clip the wings of India\u2019s battered civil society. New regulations put onerous conditions on civil society organisations, and educational and research institutions that have partnerships, including of a financial nature, with foreign entities. Passions overwhelm rationality in conversations on foreign influences, and it could well be true that a portion of such foreign assistance may be reaching the wrong hands. In Parliament, the BJP alleged that foreign money was being used for religious conversions. In 2017, the government barred American Christian charity, Compassion International, accusing it of supporting conversions. The debate on religious propagation and conversions must be delinked from the question of foreign funding. There are adequate laws against conversion by inducement, and the right or wrong of it cannot be decided against the touchstone of the source of funds, native or foreign. Some of the restrictions appear well meaning, but could impact NGOs besides showing up India to be overregulated.\n\nThe International Commission of Jurists has said the new law was incompatible with international obligations and India\u2019s own constitutional provisions on rights. Seamless sharing of ideas and resources across national boundaries is essential to the functioning of a global community, and should not be discouraged unless there is reason to believe the funds are being used to aid illegal activities. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often cited the ancient Indian ethos of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam as the framework for its global engagement. The pandemic has only underscored the importance of this approach. As a growing economy, India under Mr. Modi has been proactive in seeking global capital and technology. The aversion appears to be towards select categories of global ideas and ideals \u2014 environmentalism, human rights and civil liberties. Organisations working in these fields have often had their patriotism being called into question. To be fair, this approach predates the current government, and it was during the UPA that an official report even quantified the GDP losses allegedly caused by environmental NGOs, insinuating a foreign conspiracy against India. Such paranoia does not go well with India\u2019s legitimate ambitions to be a global player. The BJP and the Congress are well aware of the limits of the national-foreign binary. In 2017, both joined hands to legislate an escape route after receiving funds from foreign entities in violation of FCRA provisions. Thousands of NGOs serve extremely disadvantaged sections, at times filling in for the state, at others, supplementing it. A presumption of guilt against them all, followed by control, amounts to throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The world is poorer when new barriers are raised.",

    "text": "With a resolution to the stand-off far away, New Delhi must study how Beijing has handled its other boundary disputes\n\nThe mystic, celestial snow lion, \u2018Gang Seng Ge\u2019 in local lore, derives its name from the Sanskrit Simha. It is the emblem of Tibet showcasing its eternally snow-covered mountains and glaciers, even as it symbolises power, strength, fearlessness and the joy of living. It is also the symbol and the flag of the intrepid, fearless warriors of the \u2018Special Frontier Force\u2019, or the SFF, which has figured so prominently in the recent clashes in eastern Ladakh.\n\nStandoff in the heights\n\nTowards the end of April this year, 4 Motorised and 6 Mechanised Divisions of the Chinese Western Theatre Command, having completed their exercises on the edge of the Gobi Desert, took to the Xinjiang highway. In a well-planned and rehearsed move, they branched off onto a series of feeder roads on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. Once the troops were in position, they initiated multiple incursions across the LAC into what had been \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d patrolled by both sides (India and China). This included areas in the Depsang plains threatening the forward airstrip of Daulat Beg Oldie as also the north and the south of the expansive Pangong Tso salt water lake.\n\nSpecial Frontier Force | They came, they fought, they stayed\n\nThe world watched in horror, as soldiers of two nuclear armed Asian giants engaged each other in a slug fest on the snowy summits of the Himalayas. In the melee that followed, they went at each other with clubs studded with barbed wire, machetes and rocks, resulting in serious injuries. Not a shot was fired, but the Indian Army which was initially surprised, reacted swiftly and with bravery and courage inflicted casualties to the Chinese side.\n\nThe inevitable fallout of these actions was both sides jostling for heights, leading to a stalemate. Suddenly, on the night of August 29-30, in a surprise move, the Indian Army turned the tables on China by occupying heights that were not only of great tactical importance north and south of the Pangong Tso lake as also dominating the Spangur Gap. It was now looking into the innards of the Chinese depth localities at Moldo including China\u2019s armour, guns and reserves. This amazing feat was accomplished primarily by a Ghost Army, the Special Frontier Force. Who are these super human troops? What are their antecedents? They are the dreaded shadow warriors of the SFF.\n\nWorking in the shadows\n\nDuring the era of the \u201cGreat Game\u201d, the British employed natives to patrol their own lands, which included Tibetans. It was the Mustang Base in the Northern Border Range that escorted the 14th Dalai Lama to safety to India during the 1959 rebellion. As a consequence of the 1962 war, the Jawaharlal Nehru government ordered the raising of an elite Commando Force called the Special Frontier Force comprising among others, Tibetans who had sought refuge in India along with the Dalai Lama.\n\nAlso read | With public funeral for Tibetan soldier, Delhi sends a signal to Beijing\n\nMy father, Major General Sujan Singh Uban, was a natural choice for this based on sheer merit and his being a legendary war veteran of the British Army famous for his daring exploits with the Long Range Desert Group in the Middle East, and the Guerrilla Wars in Burma during World War II. He was tasked with raising, training and commanding this nascent Force; as also moulding them into a well-oiled fighting machine.\n\nTo enhance their inherent fighting capabilities its members were given airborne training in addition to acquiring expertise in mountain and jungle warfare. Initially aided and equipped by the United States, they quickly indigenised and were soon on their own feet. The opportunity to display their mettle as also to repay their host country came during the India-Pakistan war of 1971. As the Indian Army moved in with its major thrust into East Pakistan, the SFF, while supporting the flank of the Indian Army, in a blitzkrieg cleared the Chittagong hill tracts, as also the Kaptai dam, and encircled and prevented the escape of the Pakistani 97 (Indep) Brigade and No 2 Commando Battalion, all of whom were taken prisoners. The SFF was poised for the capture of Chittagong port when a ceasefire was declared; a daring move which paid handsome dividends. This earned them the nom de guerre, the \u2018Phantoms of Chittagong\u2019.\n\nAlso read | India's secret war in Bangladesh\n\nThe importance of Tibet\n\nIt soon became my turn to serve the SFF, enabling me to fulfil a family commitment. Having performed exceedingly well in the Indian Army (including being awarded the Vishisht Seva Medal (VSM) and based on my record of service) I was promoted as Inspector General to command the SFF and was privileged to command it during the Kargil war in battles fought at heights of 14,000 feet and above in subzero temperatures; actions which were lauded in the Ladakh and Kargil sectors. That year, the security for the Amarnath Yatra was provided by the SFF.\n\nThe strategic importance of Tibet cannot be overemphasised. It is the roof of the world, with vast mineral and natural resources. The mighty rivers that emanate from its expansive glaciers \u2014 such as the Brahmaputra, the Yangtse, the Yellow river, the Mekong, the Salween and the Indus \u2014 together with thousands of their tributaries have nurtured civilisations in peripheral countries for centuries. The Kailash Mansarovar, which is centered in this region and with its spiritual overtones, tugs at the heart strings of every Indian. In an act of naked aggression, China occupied Tibet in 1959.\n\nA buffer was eliminated, and the de facto boundary of China became contiguous to that of India, a boundary deliberately left undemarcated to enable further expansion. Mao Zedong declared, \u201cTibet is the palm that we shall occupy and then go after the five fingers, Ladakh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.\u201d Consequently, in 1959, China committed the naked act of aggression, to which India acquiesced, and our dream of \u201cHindi Chini Bhai Bhai\u201d was rudely shaken in 1962.\n\nComment | A phantom called the Line of Actual Control\n\nUnderstanding China\u2019s stand\n\nIndia is dealing with a bellicose neighbour, with its obsession for asserting its rights over land which its predecessors may have acquired through conquest or guile. China has land borders with 14 neighbours covering an estimated 22,100 kilometres. Post independence, and as its economic status burgeoned, so did its military muscle. China embarked on claims based on perceived imbalances of treaties forced on countries when they were weak.\n\nSome of these have since been resolved after bloody clashes such as with Russia and Vietnam, while others have been resolved using a combination of lucrative offers of money, trade and guile. In most cases, the end result has been such that victory can be claimed by both sides.\n\nRussia accepted half of China\u2019s claim, Kazakhstan was given lucrative economic deals, Kyrgyzstan retained 70% of the land, ceding just 30%, and so on.\n\nThe Hindu Explains | What are the agreements that govern India and China\u2019s actions?\n\nIt would be fallacious to surmise that there will be any resolution to the on-going stand-off between India and China in the near future. Let us assume that both countries wish to avoid a full-scale war considering the nuclear backdrop, the COVID-19 pandemic and also the economic downturn. The road ahead will have to be evolved and based on a study of the manner in which China has negotiated its boundary disputes with 12 of its neighbours and the results achieved.\n\nWhat must be done\n\nThere can be little doubt that the actions by the People\u2019s Liberation Army, or the PLA, in Ladakh were pre-meditated, planned and executed with precision. The Chinese were fully aware that they were transgressing into \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d. With a pre-determined aim in mind they proceeded to secure tactical heights and gained access to the areas which would forestall a counter-offensive by the Indian Army. To expect them to vacate these areas at this juncture would be naive. At the same time, the PLA, in its present configuration and posture, has immense weaknesses which they would be aware of, and which should make them uneasy.\n\nUnder the prevailing circumstances, it has become imperative to form a group of experts from among retired professionals, who have a proven track record with the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, diplomats, the intelligence services, cyber technology and cartographic services, who will plan and prepare, short-, medium- and long-term goals to achieve them within a suggested time frame. Let us play down the rhetoric and adopt a pragmatic approach. It can no longer be a part-time issue to be addressed only when a crisis occurs. The crisis is upon us now.\n\nGurdip Singh Uban is former Inspector General, Special Frontier Force",

    "text": "The APMC Bypass Bill leaves too much to the benevolence of private players\n\nThree farm bills \u2014 the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, the Farmers\u2019 Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill (commonly referred to as the APMC Bypass Bill), and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill \u2014 were cleared by Parliament amid protests from the Opposition. Sudha Narayanan and Arindam Banerjee discuss the implications of the controversial Bills in a conversation moderated by Vikas Dhoot. Edited excerpts:\n\nWhat are the concerns about these Bills? Do they hold up?\n\nSudha Narayanan: Sometimes we say, \u2018Be careful what you wish for, you may actually get it\u2019. These Bills represent fairly important changes in marketing regulation and are what many were asking for because of the flaws in the APMC [Agricultural Produce Market Committee] system. But at the same time, they are worrying for two reasons. The first is in what they say. The Bills have lacunae: lack of regulation, regulatory oversight and reporting. They\u2019re somewhat non-transparent. The second is what they do not say. You can\u2019t have marketing Bills that are devoid of the larger context of State intervention in agriculture, and agricultural policy.\n\nCould you give us examples of a couple of those?\n\nSudha Narayanan: The APMC bypass Bill is the most controversial. This Bill actually assumes that private players don\u2019t exist today and the APMC is a monopoly. That is a flawed assumption. Private players actually look to the APMC for a reference price to conduct their own transactions.\n\nNow you\u2019re trying to create an alternative that\u2019s outside the APMC, which is on advantageous terms where you don\u2019t have to pay mandi fees or taxes. This could result in two perverse consequences. One is that the APMC continues to set the reference price. That makes no sense because if your private players are still looking to the APMC for a reference price, then your idea of getting rid of the inefficient APMC doesn\u2019t hold. Large-scale trade outside the mandi is bound to happen because new players will prefer to trade outside the mandi because they don\u2019t have to pay charges. APMC traders too might now prefer to operate outside the mandi for the same reason. So, if the APMC system collapses, then this Bill hasn\u2019t envisioned any alternative for a large market that can actually set price signals. So, instead of unifying the national market, you could actually have little bargaining islands where people are just setting prices. This might undermine farmer interests. And in that new trade area, there is no regulation, no data, transactions are invisible. In the current APMC system, even with its flaws, at least there is some recording and grievance redressal. The current Bill leaves too much to the benevolence of private players to give fair terms to the farmers.\n\nAlso read | Read farm Bills before stoking fears that farmers will suffer: Jal Shakti Minister tells Opposition\n\nArindam Banerjee: Private trade in agricultural commodities is not something new in India. At the same time, the justification for these Bills at this point of time is primarily, I think, to facilitate bigger private players into the farm sector. There are several reasons for that. The government\u2019s justification is hinged on farmers getting better prices for their produce because they are going to get greater choices. Now, the farmers, at least the big farmers, and net surplus producers don\u2019t seem convinced. The reason is that market prices or farmers\u2019 incomes are not simply dependent on the market structure. Farmers\u2019 organisations are concerned that other demands are being ignored, particularly during this difficult economic situation. Market prices are sluggish because demand is sluggish. Farmers\u2019 incomes are actually seeing a period of stagnation. The other concern for farmers has been growing input costs. Farmers have been squeezed between rising costs of cultivation and sluggish prices. These concerns need interventions from the government in the form of subsidies or procurement. There is MSP [Minimum Support Price] and procurement but one major concern is that certain policy documents were presented before the government earlier, which talked about replacing the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and PDS with cash transfers.\n\nWhat might happen as a result of the facilitation of big players into the farm sector is that some farmers will get better choices and big farmers will actually start selling to the private players. There is a possibility that the importance of the APMC and the procurement system will actually wither away over time. And that concerns everybody.\n\nAlso read | Congress made the same promises: Narendra Singh Tomar on farm bills\n\nThere is concern that big retail players and corporates could end up monopolising farm trade and vitiate farmers\u2019 interests. What are the global precedents and can we learn something from there?\n\nSudha Narayanan: Internationally, we\u2019ve seen cartels. The French dairy producers and the dairy farmers\u2019 co-operatives in the U.S. have become huge players. A lot of buyer cartels fix the price, and that\u2019s one of the reasons the EU and the U.S. are taking a hard look at their own supply chains to reduce the power of consolidation.\n\nIn India, it\u2019s going to be less predictable, because big players themselves want to minimise costs. The traditional marketing channels are very resilient\u2026 if the farmer goes to a trader, it is for multiple reasons, not just the sale of crop. The trader extends credit, has a deeper relationship of trust and he will take all kinds of quality. The farmer runs a lot of risks dealing with the big players. It\u2019s not a given that the big players will come in, set up shop and crowd out other players. But if they manage to get a place, there are two ways in which I have seen them operate. One is to try to crowd out competition and the other is to co-opt them. Big businesses are well positioned to interact with a lot of farmers because they have the field staff. But eventually, many of them end up co-opting farmer cooperatives or anybody who\u2019s able to aggregate produce for them. So, though we keep saying that these Bills will facilitate direct transactions with farmers, what we are seeing is not dis-intermediation, but re-intermediation. Companies will find that it\u2019s too expensive to work with a large number of farmers and look for intermediaries who will aggregate produce for them.\n\nAlso read | In Punjab, farmers hold \u2018rail roko\u2019 against farm Bills\n\nArindam Banerjee: If you look at the global experience, corporate food markets are all about monopolies or duopolies. So, we can expect that to happen. But what I\u2019m more concerned about is this: private trade in agricultural commodities has existed for several years in India, so what is the new usefulness from the perspective of big capital? Pepsi has been in the potato value chain and there are several other examples of contract farming. I think the new thrust area is the grain trade in India and that is where procurement by the government happens. I think global corporates are eyeing the grain market. With more than 90 million tonnes of foodgrain in our stocks, it is clear that there is a massive market to play around with, only if there is a relative shift of weight from government regulation to private players. Even with the pandemic measures, the stocks have not reduced. The pandemic has caused massive disruption of jobs globally. Consequently, it has caused a massive disruption for capital and profits as well. Agricultural goods have suffered less because these are necessary items in consumption baskets. There is less chance of revival of demand of industrial goods and services to pre-pandemic levels in the near future. This is why big capital is trying to move into the agricultural commodity trade on a bigger scale, so that it can recover some of its lost profits.\n\nComment | It\u2019s a no green signal from the farm world\n\nWhile the Bills are said to give farmers more choices, shouldn\u2019t they also have more predictable trade policies to work with? Every time prices rise, exports are curbed as we see with onions now.\n\nSudha Narayanan: What you said is important. Look at what happened after these ordinances were passed. We had the ban on export of onions. So the farmers are not getting a signal that these Bills are, in fact, farmer-centric. There\u2019s nothing in the Bills that says what the procurement policy is going to be. In general, when you want to protect the interests of the consumers, while not undermining the interests of the farmers, you have an array of policies that work together. You can\u2019t say, I\u2019m not going to use the Essential Commodities Act and then try to influence consumer prices by a policy that hurts farmers.\n\nExplainer | Why are the Agriculture Bills being opposed\n\nThe Opposition and some farmer groups want the MSP to be added to the legal framework so that they have a floor price of sorts. Is that some kind of a solution for now?\n\nArindam Banerjee: The FCI was formed in 1965 as a response to a significant food shortage in the country. From that point, we have made progress in food production. In the early 1990s, we were not facing food shortages. That did not mean that the problem of hunger was addressed. It continues to persist because there is mal-distribution of foodgrain. And that is happening in spite of the PDS. One has to recognise that we have a different political-economic regime than the time the FCI was set up. Post-liberalisation, private players and capital have a much greater role to play in the economy, which is fine. But then you also need regulations for those players. So, if today there is a perceived concern about the government public procurement system, then it\u2019s a valid demand to include a clause regarding procurement, or maybe just bring in another law that would quell a lot of fears.\n\nAlso read | Why is govt. \u2018running away\u2019 from giving legal responsibility for MSP, asks Congress\n\nSudha Narayanan: Given that these Bills are quite problematic, I wouldn\u2019t want an MSP clause to be introduced into them. If these Bills are flawed, we have to think of ways of fixing them. And I think the MSP question is larger, more complex, and deserves a very serious consultative process, and its own dedicated Act. Now the two may not be compatible. Because you can\u2019t say I want to get private players but insist what price they deal with. That\u2019s going to be self-defeating both for the MSP as well as for private participation. The reason MSP has to be a separate question is because farmers from Punjab may disagree with farmers from Bihar. So, how are you going to enforce the MSP? There have been interesting suggestions there. One suggestion was, if the APMCs were functioning as they would under the old regime, then you would ensure that all bidding starts at the MSP, which ensures that the MSP starts as a floor price. We\u2019ve lost that opportunity now because now if you say APMC has a MSP, but outside it, you can do whatever you want, then it makes no sense any more.\n\nIf we keep an MSP that actually forces the government to procure way more than it needs (like China did a decade ago and could not distribute it within the country or export it), then unless you have a very well-planned distribution system, does it make economic sense for the government? Who is going to take responsibility, and how is it going to be geographically distributed and across crops? So, even if you were to go for an MSP legislation, there needs to be serious discussion on all these different aspects.\n\nAlso read | Government should bring in another Bill or amend current one, says RSS-affiliate SJM\n\nIs there any scope for course corrections in these Bills?\n\nArindam Banerjee: There cannot be minor tweaks; major corrections need to be done. The consultative process that was missing within our federal democratic structure... at least some amount of that needs to be done. I may sound like an alarmist, but on the face of it, if these Bills undermine the grain procurement system, there could be Balkanisation of the country. It\u2019s not simply a matter of farmers anymore, it\u2019s a much deeper concern.\n\nArindam Banerjee is Associate Professor at the School of Liberal Studies at Ambedkar University; Sudha Narayanan is Associate Professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research",

A list of State Helpline numbers is available as well.\n\nHere are the latest updates:\n\n10.00 am | China\n\nChinese company says coronavirus vaccine ready by early 2021\n\nA Chinese pharmaceutical company said on Thursday the coronavirus vaccine it is developing should be ready by early 2021 for distribution worldwide, including the United States.\n\nYin Weidong, the CEO of SinoVac, vowed to apply to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sell CoronaVac in the United States if it passes its third and final round of testing in humans. Mr. Yin said he personally has been given the experimental vaccine.\n\n\u201cAt the very beginning, our strategy was designed for China and for Wuhan.

Neither the staff at the facility nor the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) administration have the slightest clue of her \u2018disappearance\u2019.\n\nThe woman had first gone to the COVID-19 facility in the city\u2019s Balewadi but was referred to the Sassoon General Hospital as the former was full. As the latter hospital, too, was full to capacity, she was admitted to the CoEP facility on August 30.\n\nTwo weeks later, when the patient\u2019s mother, Ragini Gambire, visited the jumbo facility to collect her daughter, she was faced with an array of bewildering answers regarding her daughter\u2019s presence in the facility.\n\n9.30 am | Tamil Nadu\n\nChennai Corporation removes all containment zones\n\nAt one point of time, there were more than 1,000 containment zones in the city. The number fell to less than 10 last week.\n\nThe Greater Chennai Corporation has removed all COVID-19 containment zones in its 15 zones, although there was a spike in the number of new COVID-19 cases on Thursday. City Health Officer Jagadeesan said the city did not have any street with more than three index cases. \u201cSo, we have not earmarked containment zones,\u201d said Dr. Jagadeesan.\n\nA street is barricaded in the event of three index cases and if officials are unable to trace contacts that caused the infection.\n\nOn Thursday, the city reported no containment zones.

These flights are governed by the regulatory mechanism of the country of origin, irrespective of the fact whether the carrier is Indian or not... Refund of tickets/credit shells of international flights would be governed by the law of the sovereign country from where such flights originate,\u201d the affidavit filed jointly for DGCA and the Ministry said.\n\nThe Ministry was replying to questions raised by the airlines and the petitioner, Pravasi Legal Cell, represented by senior advocate Sanjay Hegde and advocate Jose Abraham. The case is scheduled to be heard on September 25.\n\n9.00 am | Tripura\n\nSchools in Tripura to reopen on October 5\n\nThe Tripura government has allowed schools to function from October 5 with strict adherence to the norms issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in view of the pandemic.\n\nThe State\u2019s education department officials said on Thursday that government and private schools will reopen with 50% teaching staff. The school management would prepare a roster to ensure attendance of 50% teachers on an alternate-day basis, they added.\n\nThe percentage of students has not been specified for attendance, but those who want to attend will have to carry written permission from their parents, the officials stated.\n\n8.30 am | United Kingdom\n\nNovavax starts late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trial in U.K.\n\nNovavax Inc on Thursday started a late-stage trial of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine in partnership with the UK government's Vaccines Taskforce, sending the company's shares up 6% after the bell.\n\nThe trial is expected to enroll and test the vaccine in up to 10,000 participants aged between 18 and 84 years over the next four to six weeks. The trial will enroll at least 25% of participants over the age of 65 and prioritize groups most affected by the COVID-19, the company said.\n\nData from the trial will support regulatory submissions for license in the U.K., EU and other countries, the company said.\n\n8.00 am | France\n\nFrench Open to allow just 1,000 people a day at Roland Garros\n\nA maximum of only 1,000 people will be allowed each day at Roland Garros after the French government insisted Thursday on tougher restrictions to counter the resurgence of the coronavirus.\n\nOrganisers of the French Open, which gets underway four months later than planned in Paris on Sunday, had hoped for a maximum of 5,000. That figure had already been reduced from 20,000 and then 11,500.\n\nThe decision by the French government will be a huge blow to Roland Garros which last year attracted on average around 37,000 fans a day.",

The Corporate Affairs Ministry notified a further three-month extension on Thursday evening, when that six-month period was due to end.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the extension of the suspension of sections 7, 9 and 10 of the IBC reinforces the government\u2019s commitment to protecting businesses. \u201cIt also gives companies breathing time to recover from financial stress,\u201d she said in a tweet. The government had issued an ordinance to amend the IBC in June to enable the suspension of the Code\u2019s provisions for firms committing defaults after March 25. The ordinance permits the government to extend the suspension of insolvency invocation for up to one year, and was passed as a legislation by Parliament this week.\n\n\u2018Result still elusive\u2019\n\n\u201cThe notification was expected but the desired result is still elusive,\u201d said Anoop Rawat, partner, insolvency and bankruptcy at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.\n\n\u201cThe rate of stress resolution outside IBC is abysmal and the stress is only accumulating,\u201d he added. Mr. Rawat hoped the three months could be used to build stakeholder consensus on resolving the stress created on account of COVID-19 to avoid further build-up of stress at the end of the period.\n\nWhile the economy contracted more than 23% in the first quarter, when the harshest lockdown restrictions were in place, the industry is yet to see a significant revival in revenues as consumers remain cautious and hold on to cash amid a surge in novel coronavirus infections and dwindling jobs and incomes.\n\nThe suspension of the corporate insolvency resolution process for another three months will help companies stay afloat, said Uttara Kolhatkar, partner at J. Sagar Associates.\n\n\u201cThe current COVID-19 situation has had a debilitating effect on the Indian economic situation and the passing of the Bill will give such stressed companies the much\u2013needed cushioning effect,\u201d she added.",

    "text": "Clear message given to Chinese that pushing back Indian soldiers physically will not work: govt. official\n\nShots have been fired in the air on multiple occasions on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh recently, and the Chinese have been given a clear message that pushing back Indian soldiers physically will not work any more, a senior government official said on Thursday.\n\nStating that once a melee happens, like the Galwan clash on June 15, opening fire was not possible, the official pointed out, \u201cNow, we said, if you come close we will fire. Distance is dependent on the conditions like day or night, location and so on... If they are about to be overrun or in self-defence, troops are authorised to fire.\u201d\n\nAt the sixth round of Corps Commander talks early this week, India and China had agreed not to send any more troops to the frontline. \u201cIt is a good start. We have to wait and watch till there is concrete action on the ground, we will not lower our guard on the ground. Our stand is you moved first, so you move back first. That will be a good confidence-building measure (CBM),\u201d the official said.\n\nThe sixth round of senior-level military-level talks also saw a joint statement being issued as well as the participation of an External Affairs Ministry official who deals with China, the official stated. Earlier, the Chinese side had tried to project that India did not have a \u201cunified\u201d stance on the continuing boundary stand-offs.\n\nAt the talks since the developments on the south bank since August 29, the Chinese want to resolve the latest incidents first, but India favoured a package resolution of the entire eastern Ladakh situation. \u201cWhen we say status quo, what we mean is status quo before May,\u201d the official stated.\n\nChinese deaths\n\nThe official revealed that the Chinese had conveyed through diplomatic channels that they had suffered five deaths, including their commanding officer, in the June 15 Galwan Valley clash, which left 20 Indian Army soldiers dead.\n\nAsked why the Chinese had acted in the way they did, the official felt there was \u201cno one overarching reason\u201d but many reasons, including turning Jammu and Kashmir into a Union Territory in August 2019 and also to divert attention from China\u2019s COVID-19 crisis.\n\nPointing out that the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in other sectors remains stable, the official said that local commanders on both sides were in contact and even they (the Chinese) had said: \u201cLet not what\u2019s happening in eastern Ladakh happen here\u201d.\n\nInterestingly, in the eastern sector, Indian and Chinese troops patrol contentious areas by weekly rotation, a formula that could be brought into play in eastern Ladakh as well.\n\nThe official asserted that there was no intelligence failure in detecting the Chinese movements in early May as they made ingress into the Indian side of the LAC. \u201cWhoever moves first has the initiative and the first mover advantage,\u201d the official, said stating they had been monitoring the Chinese all along.\n\nCurrently, troops are facing each other at Depsang, the north and south banks of Pangong Tso, and Patrolling Points 17A, Rezang La and Rechin La.\n\nOn possible collusion between China and Pakistan against India in the ongoing stand-off, the official said there was no major troop movement on the Line of Control (LoC), and only regular battalion movement was taking place.\n\n\u201cNothing unusual on that front. We don\u2019t see any build on the other side. But terror activities continue. We are quite strong on the ground, so we eliminate the threat on the LoC,\u201d the official said.\n\nOn the global support to India in the ongoing stand-off and the transgressions by China and engagement with Quad countries, the official said: \u201cAt the end of the day, you have to fight your own battles\u201d.\n\nOn the situation in the Depsang plains, where Chinese troops continue to block Indian patrols to the Patrolling Points 10-13, the official said there were one or two Chinese vehicles near the Y-junction, which kept going back and forth. Beyond the Y-junction, Indian patrols had to go on foot, which were being blocked by Chinese vehicles, the official stated, adding that patrol parties followed protocols and returned. \u201cWe have not given up our claims. It has only been temporarily halted due to the circumstances,\u201d the official said.",

This is what the spokespersons, representatives, glitterati and PR machinery of a certain ideology bank on.\n\nSo the masses look doe-eyed towards these \u2018Champions\u2019 of a vernacular in the hope to be as fluid in conversation as them for we have made English the unofficial cultural marker of success, intelligence, and confidence in our country. These public speakers who work under the guise of propagating the framework of our democracy and its principles have become the unsought half-baked teachers of socio-political movements, and are self-appointed to a position of authority simply for being skilled in a vernacular.\n\nWhen one is regularly on television and storms up a verbose sesquipedalian tirade of philosophically twisted tales of morality it sounds like music to the ears, they sound \u2018intellectual\u2019. Beware! This music has melody but lacks harmony; it is not based on facts, testimonies, ground reporting, evidence, or even the overwhelming throb of public opinion. For who cares about public opinion when it can easily be influenced to match the \u2018Champions\u2019 rhetoric? Who cares about facts when it can be dismissed with morphed definitions, whataboutery, and the rules of the game can be changed on whim?\n\nCrimes are being rubbished on a mass platform despite evidences being revealed on that same platform. The whataboutism of armchair-philosophers is to drone on about the technicalities of definitions while drowning out people who point towards evidential reality. \u2018Feminism\u2019 for one is a word piggybacked by elitist today with utter disregard to the scores of women who over centuries have risked their lives for the cause of empowering women. Feminism is now misappropriated by women as a fallback strawman argument, a fallacy, and to justify personal agenda.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhile we get sucked into this leeway sinking ship of cyclical-degenerative psy-ops, a living and breathing human being\u2019s life\u2019s toil was decimated before her eyes. Kangana Ranaut\u2019s story is popular right now as a woman singled out and life savings destroyed for being a curt and outspoken individual. The visual proof of this act is ingrained in the minds of the masses yet the disillusioned elitist believe their aphrodisiac, whataboutism, and flair for language is potent enough to hypnotize and blind the masses.\n\nThey claim she does not deserve the support of feminists and label her \u2018crazy\u2019, \u2018motor mouth\u2019 and have thrown a further slew of degrading terms best not written or thought about. Busy in their clapbacks and running their baseless campaigns they have forgotten that Kangana is entitled to the term feminism and its bylines of empowerment by default due to her gender. The elitist have forgotten that they are not the keepers of the Oxford Dictionary and do not define the historical legacy of the term \u2018feminism\u2019, they have never made a dent in propagating feminism, and will continually flounder in their palace of illusions where words speak louder than action.\n\nWe have witnessed how feminism misappropriated is slyly backtracked from Kangana selectively marginalizing her, curses are lurched, a slew of FIR\u2019s are lodged, she is called out for being brazen and rough around the edges, mud is thrown on her as her fraternity deems her \u2018ungrateful\u2019 towards them for they imagine they have built her success. The glitterati admit that they are in a position of power and have outcast Kangana from their \u2018fraternity\u2019, they have even taken to the floor of the Parliament flexing their political pull. The elitist have openly claimed that the breaking of Kangana\u2019s office is \u2018revenge\u2019 and they feel justice has been served.\n\nThese are the same open minded, easy-going people who carry Gandhi\u2019s vigil of \u2018Ahimsa\u2019 on their invisible mantle, the same people who claim others carry too much anger and cannot imagine living that way while they overflow with hatred. It is a vindictive and manipulative war of words hidden behind a thinly veiled passive aggressive and overtly aggressive stance, a multifaceted war on a single being. This is what feminism fights and the masses detest \u2013 privilege. The elitist sitting on the throne of their God Complex feel they know better, that they are better, and openly play the power card to intimidate others. They are high-end bullies.\n\n\u2018Investigative journalism is a media trial\u2019, is the fallacy of a negative conclusion from an affirmative premise. It is another strawman argument picked up from the title of an entertaining Netflix series \u2018Trial by Media\u2019, a borrowed ideologue which doesn\u2019t apply to the Indian context. \u2018Trial by Media\u2019 was a series that showed how Jury duty (12 commoners selected to judge a crime with no experience in jurisprudence) in the United States of America is influenced by the media.\n\nThere is no jury duty in India, we have a Bench of Honourable Judges. To state that our Honourable Judges in the High Court and Supreme Court will be influenced by the media and by popular opinion, that they will ignore all the testimonies and evidences presented to them to appease the masses is an insult to their education, intelligence, and accomplishments of the Bench.\n\nThe fact is our \u2018Champions\u2019 suddenly do not understand that \u2018investigative journalism\u2019 is just that, it is journalism that requires investigation and the divulgence of information irrespective of appeasing the powers that may be. There will be new information unearthed through interviews and data collection. It is also known as, \u2018a journalist is doing their job.\u2019 To have a debate on national television on the job description of a journalist is a Kamikaze attack. Our Chamipons, elitists and spokespersons have realized the bitter truth of their failing PR machinery and are now flying towards us with fuel drained, ready to sacrifice themselves in the battle field as long as they go out swinging.\n\nThe kryptonite of the masses is a cocktail of influence and power resulting in a potent aphrodisiac wielded as the ultimate weapon to achieve mass persuasion. Add to that a simple marketing tool where you constantly bombard words to create a morphed ideological standing army. An army that is ready to spew the trickled down catchphrases when logical arguments fail. Let\u2019s change the topsy-turvy narrative that furthers personal political agendas. Let\u2019s not be disillusion by a world where words speak louder than action. Let\u2019s put an end to being foolishly misguided by self-proclaimed torchbearers of justice who distort past-present-future through misappropriation.\n\n\u201cYou bring me the man, I\u2019ll find you the crime.\u201d Lavrentiy Beria, chief of the Soviet secret police.\n\nThe article has been authored by Lalita Nijhawan, convenor of GIA.",

    "text": "In the current parliament session, three bills \u2013 Code on Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions, Industrial Relations Code and Social Security Code were passed to reform Labour laws.\n\nThe central government had said that there are over 100 state and 40 central laws regulating various aspects of labour such as the resolution of industrial disputes, working conditions, social security and wages. The Second National Commission on Labour (2002) found existing legislation to be complex, with outdated provisions and inconsistent definition, hence, to improve ease of compliance, the Commission recommended the consolidation of central labour laws into broader groups.\n\nIn 2019, the Ministry of Labour and Employment introduced four Bills to consolidate 29 central laws. While the Code on Wages, 2019 was passed by Parliament, Bills on other areas were referred to the Standing Committee on Labour. The Standing Committee submitted its report on the three Bills, and then, the Modi government replaced these Bills with new ones on September 19, 2020. To that end, the three bills \u2013 Code on Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions, Industrial Relations Code and Social Security Code were passed.\n\nThere have been several questions raised in connection with the three bills passed by the parliament and in this article, we aim to answer 5 such questions that have been raised.\n\nThe Industrial Relations Code 2020\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Industrial Relations Code seeks to replace three specific labour laws:\n\nThe Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The Trade Unions Act, 1926. The Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946.\n\nQuestion 1: Unites up to 300 can hire and fire without seeking government permission, and thus, it might lead to increased hiring and firing\n\nThe threshold that has been increased from 100 to 300 was recommended by The Parliamentary Standing Committee. The Parliamentary Standing Committee has recommended that the threshold of one hundred workers may be increased to three hundred workers for seeking prior permission for lay-off, retrenchment and closure. In the previous provisions, the rule of prior government permission for hire and fire only pertained to factories, mines and plantations.\n\nThe criticism in this case is that this change in the law would compromise the workers\u2019 rights and promote firing practises. However, the only change in this aspect is that units with up to 300 workers will not have to take prior permission of the appropriate Government before hiring and firing. The workers\u2019 rights workers such as notice before retrenchment, compensation at the rate of 15 days wages per completed year of service and pay in lieu of notice period has not been compromised.\n\nIt is to be kept in mind that there is no evidence that a change of this rule to extend it to units with up to 300 workers would promote hire and fire practises. What is also being pushed under the rug is that the Industrial Relations Code envisages an additional monetary benefit equivalent to 15 days of wages under newly created Reskilling Fund.\n\nThe Economic Survey, 2019 had analysed that due to the threshold of 100 workers, there were several businesses that were incentivised to remain a small unit. The State of Rajasthan in 2014 had increased the threshold from 100 to 300 workers and done away with the requirement of prior permission before retrenchment etc., in case of firms having less than 300 workers. The impact of increase in threshold in the state of Rajasthan, showed that average number of factories in Rajasthan having more than 100 increased significantly as compared to the rest of India. The total output in those factories also increased.\n\nFollowing the footsteps of Rajasthan, 15 more States have enhanced threshold to 300 workers even before the Industrial Relations Code 2020 was passed. These States include, AP, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, HP, Jharkhand, Karnataka, MP, Meghalaya, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan and UP.\n\nQuestion 2: Won\u2019t Fixed Term Employment introduce hire and fire\n\nBy several people, the introduction of \u2018Fixed Term Employment\u2019 is being touted as a new rule that has been introduced by the government. However, Fixed Term Employment has already been notified by Central Government and 14 other States. These States include Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand (apparel and made up) Karnataka, MP, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, UP (textile and EOU), and Uttarakhand.\n\nEarlier, an employer could only hire either permanent employees or contractual employees. There were several issues with this limitation. The employer often had to hire unskilled labourers with no commitment and long term relationship with the company, in case of contractual employees. There have also been allegations that the contractors charges full amount in terms of minimum wage and other entitled benefits like EPF, ESIC but do not pass the same to the contract labour.\n\nHowever, now with the introduction of Fixed Term Employment, the employer can directly get into a fixed term contract with the employee without the middleman. A fixed term employee has been made statutorily entitled for all benefits and service conditions equivalent to that of a regular employee. In fact the code on Industrial Relations also extends benefit of gratuity even for a Fixed Term Employee contract of one year which is five years in case of regular employee.\n\nHence, the introduction of the Fixed Term Employee option is actually a pro-labour reform that the Industrial Relations Code, 2020 has introduced.\n\nThe Occupational Safety, Health and Working Condition Code, 2020\n\nThe Occupational Safety, Health and Working Condition Code, 2020 consolidates 13 acts regulating health, safety and working conditions. These include Factories Act 1948, The Mines Act 1952, and the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970.\n\nQuestion 1: The definition of Inter-State Migrant worker is different in Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act, 1979 Act and new Code \u2013 will it create confusion?\n\nThe Inter-state Migrant Worker Act, 1979 has been subsumed in OSH Code. The various provisions of the erstwhile Act have been further strengthened in the OSH Code. The definition of Inter-State Migrant worker is same in the Social Security Code and the OSH Code.\n\nThe definition of the inter-state migrant worker was very restrictive in the Inter-state Migrant Worker Act, 1979. It provided that a person who is recruited through a contractor in one state for employment in another state, to be an \u2018Inter-state Migrant Worker\u2019. The OSH Code expands the definition of the migrant worker to include those workers who would be directly employed by the employer besides by contractor. Further, it has also been made possible that a migrant, who comes on his own, in the destination State, can declare himself a migrant worker by registering on an electronic portal on the basis of self-declaration seeded with Aaadhar. The registration on the portal has been made simple and there is no requirement of any other document except Aaadhar.\n\nThe Ministry in this regard has also taken steps to develop a national database to enrol unorganised workers including migrants, which will inter-alia help migrant workers get jobs, map their skills and provide other social security benefits. It will also help in better policy formulation for unorganised sector workers, in general.\n\nA statutory provision for helpline for migrant workers has also been made.\n\nThe migrant workers will also be able to enjoy the benefits of portability in respect of ration and avail benefits from building and other construction cess. They will also get all other benefits of ESIC, EPFO and annual medical check-up etc.\n\nQuestion 2: Won\u2019t night shifts for women compromise their safety?\n\nGender equality in the workplace and in hiring practices has been a long-time demand. The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Condition code ensures that gender equality is maintained in workplaces and women, should they want, be entitled to get the same working opportunity, including the night shift.\n\nHowever, safety of women is always a paramount concern and to that end, sufficient safeguards for employing women at night have been provided. The consent of women for employing them at night has been made mandatory. Further, it is said that the appropriate government shall prescribe conditions for safety, holidays and working hours or other conditions before permitting women to work at night.\n\nQuestion 3: Have Welfare provisions been diluted in the new Codes?\n\nIt is being alleged that in the new code, several welfare benefits have been diluted and that would affect the rights and well-being of the workers. However, that allegation is far from the truth since several new provisions for the welfare of the workers have been introduced through these bills.\n\nFollowing are some of the welfare provisions:",

These far away lands and islands, beyond the mountains and seas of the east, were also reputed for their spices that added further to the attractions for these ancient Indian merchants. These same spices became a much sought after commodity for the Arabs in the 9th and 10th centuries, and the Europeans in the 15th century.\n\nMap of sea routes to the Far East.

Geographically the Indo Chinese Peninsula comprises of long hill ranges of granite stones, narrow valleys, evergreen forests, alluvial plains, small islands, and innumerable rivers. It is made up of the modern day Myanmar (Burma), Thailand (Siam), Malay Peninsula, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam (Cochin China, Tonkin, and Annam). The East Indies, variously referred to as the Indian Archipelago, Malay Archipelago, or Asiatic Archipelago, is made up of more than 6000 islands. These islands include Sumatra, Bali, Java, Lombok, Borneo, Moluccas (spice islands), Celebes, New Guinea, Philippines, and many more smaller islands. The South China sea separates the Indo-China peninsular area from the Archipelago. The ancient Indians referred to these areas of the Peninsula and the Archipelago as Suvarnabhumi, while Malay Peninsula was specifically known as Suvarnadvipa: the proverbial land of wealth that yielded gold (both literally and figuratively).\n\nMany of the common Indians who travelled to these places settled down permanently and married local women, while the Princes who arrived would establish new kingdoms. Both led to widespread Indianisation of these Far East societies, leading to the spread of Hinduism and Buddhism in these areas through art, literature, language, and social customs. A Chinese eyewitness account of such a kingdom in Malay peninsula (Tuein-suin) talks of \u201c500 merchant families, 200 Buddhists, and thousands of Brahmins\u201d settled permanently in that country, and talks of locals giving their daughters in marriages to these Indians.\n\nPainting of a 5th century CE three mast sail-ship from India- Ajanta Cave 17, Photo from Wikipedia, in public domain.\n\nThe movements of the ancient Indians to this Suvarnabhumi in search of wealth and adventure was primarily via the sea route. Starting from the north there was the famous port known as Tamralipti (now known as Tamluk in Midnapur district, West Bengal) from where ships and boats would set sail following the coastline of Bengal and Burma, or they would cross the Bay of Bengal straight to go directly to the Malay Peninsula, East Indies, or farther beyond to Indo China. The other famous ports from ancient and early medieval India were Palura near Gopalpur in Odisha and three near Masulipatam (Machilipatnam) from where regular ships would set sail for the Far East. Another regular sea route started from the Ganges mouth via the eastern coast to Ceylon or Sri Lanka, then from there via the western coast to Broach (Bharuch) at the mouth of the river Narmada in Gujarat, and then possibly farther on.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTravelers and merchants would come by land or river routes to the nearest ports, take a coastal route to reach Tamralipti, Palura, or the harbours near Masulipatam, from where they would board ships for the Far East. It is interesting to note that some of the local stories and socio-religious customs still in practice in these foreign countries point to these Indian places, which were the original homes of the travelers and merchants. As for example, in Sri Lanka, the story of the Prince Sri Vijaya from Bengal establishing a kingdom there is still a popular narrative. There is also the popular narrative of how Ashoka\u2019s descendant was shipwrecked at the Malay peninsula while escaping Magadha via Dantapura, and thereafter establishing the kingdom of Langkasuka (likely 2nd c. CE).\n\nThe same area is also associated with the Bengal Prince Sri VIjaya who established the Tambralinga kingdom (10th to 13th c. CE). The Java chronicles narrate stories of how Hindus from Kalinga established their kingdom in that island, and similar narratives are heard from other islands too. The Java chronicles also narrate the story of a Gujarati Prince who had established his kingdom in the island in 75 CE. Similarly in Pegu (now Bago), an old port city in Burma/Myanamar, there are local stories that document the coming of Indians, originally from the lower course of the Krishna and Godavari rivers, who had crossed the seas and settled down in the delta part of the river Irrawaddy and adjoining coastal areas. From these various narrations it appear that the Indians from various parts of the country would travel to the harbour ports, namely, Tamralipti, Palura, three ports near Masulipatam, and Broach, from where they embarked on their voyage for the Far East.\n\nIndian ship on lead coin of Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi, testimony to the naval, seafaring and trading capabilities of the Satavahanas during the 1st\u20132nd century CE. Photo from Wikipedia in public domain.\n\nWhile the sea route was the preferred mode of travel, the land route was also used by some to move towards the East, across Eastern Bengal, Manipur, and Assam. From old Chinese texts it is clear that in the 2nd c. BCE there was an already established and flourishing trade between China and India through the land route that moved across the upper parts of Myanmar and Yunnan. From the Chinese records (that give Chinese version of names of these places) it is seen that Indians had settled down and established significant influences over the locals not only in Myanmar, but also in Yunnan, which incidentally was known as Gandhara (Indianised name given by the Burmese people) until as late as 13th century. Yunnan had the kingdom of Nan Chao or Tali, which as per the local narratives, was established by a son of Ashoka. There were similar other kingdoms (mostly Hindu kingdoms) spread across the entire area established by Indians, such as the kingdom of Ta-tsin, and innumerable others in Pagan, Prome, Laos, Arakan, Malay peninsula, Lower Myanmar, Siam, Annam, Cambodia, Cochin China, Bali, Java, and Borneo. Many of these places still retain their Indian names with only slight changes, while the local culture and continuing socio-religious practices also show their past connections with India.\n\nModel of a Chola (200\u2014848 CE) ship\u2019s hull, built by the ASI, based on a wreck 19 miles off the coast of Poombuhar, displayed in a Museum in Tirunelveli. Photo from Wikipedia\n\nIn Myanmar as per the local traditions it is believed that long before was Buddha was born, a Sakya chief from Kapilavastu came and established his kingdom in the central part of Myanmar, which lasted for 31 generations. Later as the Sakya chief\u2019s family reign was coming to an end, there arrived a group of Kshtriyas from the Gangetic plain. The chief of this clan married the widow of the last king of the Sakya tribe, and established his own kingdom in Upper Myanmar. In the Arakan (now Rakhine-Mynamar), the local traditions say that a prince from the royal family of Banaras settled and established his kingdom at Ramavati (now name modified to Rami or Rambyi). The Cambodian historical records state that king Adityavamsha, a ruler of Indrapastha, banished one of his sons who then travelled to the country of Kok Thlok where he established his own kingdom by defeating the previous ruler. Later he married a beautiful Naga princess, whose father gifted him with a capital city, and the name of the kingdom was changed to Kamboja.\n\nSimilarly many Indian texts and folktales also preserve stories that talk of travels to the Suvarnabhumi from times before the Common Era. Many Jataka tales talk of such sea travels, such as the story where the queen of Videha (Mithila) fled to Champa (Bhagalpur) with as much treasure as she could, after her husband was defeated and killed in a battle. Her son took half her treasure and travelled in a ship with some merchants hoping to reach Suvarnabhumi, despite his mothers pleadings to not cross the dangerous seas. Despite a shipwreck the prince came back wealthy and took back his father\u2019s kingdom of Mithila. In another story it is seen that a group of carpenters from Banaras built a ship using forest wood, and they set sail towards the Far East (Suvarnabhumi) in order to find a new place to live in. They discover an island in the middle of the sea that was filled with various fruits and decided to settle down there with their families.\n\nOne of the Borobudur ships from 8th century CE, which were the large native outrigger trading vessels, possibly of the Sailendra and Srivijaya kingdoms. Shown with the characteristic tanja sail of Southeast Asian Austronesians. Photo from Wikipedia (Michael J. Lowe)\n\nBrihatkatha is another text, which is full of such stories from ancient India, and the most famous among them is that of the adventures of Sanudosa. Here Sanudosa joins a group formed by an adventurer Achera who prepares to travel to Suvarnabhumi. The travel ordeals of the group are narrated in details, and interestingly we get to hear of the many paths taken by travellers while following the land route towards the East Indies. There is the mention of vetrapatha, which means climbing up to the top of the mountain using creepers (vetra); crossing of a dangerous swift-flowing river holding onto the bamboos growing on the banks (vamsapatha); crossing of a narrow path between two precipices by riding mountain goats which is termed as ajapatha or goats\u2019 path; jannupatha (crawling on knees); sankhupatha (using an iron hook attached to a rope made of skin, which is fixed to the cliff side and the traveller climbs up the mountain using the rope- a process of rock climbing still followed by mountaineers); and chhatrapatha where the travellers use a parasol like object made of animal skin to descend to the ground slowly from a height using air pressure (much like parachutes).\n\nThe descriptions of the various undertaken paths and the dangers that Sanudosha and his group faced give a fair idea of the difficulties that travellers had to deal with while moving towards East Indies on the land route. The sea route had its own share of dangers and difficulties, which is evident from the detailed description of a sea travel recorded by the Chinese traveller Fa- hien in 5th c. CE, who took the sea route on his return journey from India to China.\n\nThe ship in which he was travelling along with 200 other merchants developed a leak, and seeing no other remedies at hand the merchants threw a part of their merchandises into the sea to lessen the burden and save the vessel from sinking. Fa-Hien gives a detailed description of how the merchants were terrified during stormy days and nights when the sky couldn\u2019t be seen, as directions were located by seeing the sun, moon, and stars, and without them they would be floating and tossing about aimlessly like a rudderless ship, completely at the mercy of the foaming bottomless ocean and the unseen rocks below the waters. It took Fa-hien and the merchants more than 90 days of such a treacherous journey to finally reach Java-dvipa (Java).\n\nIndian Boat, From Rajrajeswar Temple, Kototlpur, Hooghly, West Bengal, 1694 CE. Photo by Partha Sanyal\n\nSuch travel narratives and other literary texts (both Indian and of the Far East countries) that give us stories of Indians establishing kingdoms in far off eastern lands echo the characteristics of the then national life of India. While many merchants undertook such dangerous travels for commercial gains (wealth and prosperity), the spirit of adventure and a strong desire to explore new lands is quite clear in many of the narratives, thus reflecting the same on the characteristics of the ancient Indian people. While these stories and legends help us to get a fair idea of the existence of Hindu kingdoms in the Far East and the socio-religious lives of the people in these places, they don\u2019t give much scope to fix exact dates as to when these kingdoms were established. However from various inscriptions, sculptures, temples and temple remains, and from various Chinese and Greek literary records it is possible to say that some of these Indian kingdoms were established not later than 2nd c. CE and possibly even earlier, while trade relations of India with the Far East certainly go well back into the BCE era.\n\nReferences\n\nRadha Kumud Mookerjii.

    "text": "Cannabis is a drug derived from Indian hemp plants such as cannabis sativa and cannabis indica. The main active chemical in cannabis is THC (delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol). It is a depressant drug and slows down the activity of the central nervous system. High dosages of cannabis may have hallucinogenic effects. It is commonly known as weed, pot, joint, dope, herb, grass, among other names.\n\nThe use of cannabis dates back to thousands of years. Sharda N Bapat mentioned in her paper \u201cCannabis: the forgotten sacred plant of India\u201d that the British Government of India prohibited the consumption of cannabis resin (charas) in India in the 1930s that led to the beginning of the decline in cultivation and usage of cannabis sativa in India. While Atharvaveda mentioned cannabis as one of the five sacred plants, Ayurveda has mentioned its medicinal value.\n\nIt can be used as a source of food, fiber, oil, medicine, and recreational and spiritual purposes. Despite its multiple commercial and personal uses, the plant found its way in the list of items banned under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. Let\u2019s explore the role of international pressure and Rajiv Gandhi led government in its ban in India.\n\nThe ban in the US\n\nThe roots of the cannabis ban in India has its roots in the US. One might have noticed how states in the United States of America are now legalizing cannabis for recreational and medicinal purposes; the case was not different around 60 years ago. In the 1960s, America ran a campaign to impose a ban on cannabis. Under Article 28 of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, at the United Nations, cannabis was put under the list of substances to be highly regulated by the signatory state. As per the decisions made during the convention, only licensed personnel can cultivate or deal in the Cannabis plant.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThough the reason behind the ban was listed as to control the use of drugs and the involvement of organized crime in the cultivation and distribution of narcotics, it is believed that one of the reasons behind the ban was the possible industrial applications of the plant. Cannabis and its variants like hemp can grow in harsh conditions at a very rapid rate. Different parts of the plant can be used in making fabric, medicines, fodder, and other products. Some experts believe that as the plant was cheap to produce, it was not easy to sell products made out of it at a higher price making it less profitable for corporate.\n\nIndia ban under Rajiv Gandhi\n\nIndia was not a signatory member of the 1961 treaty between nations to ban narcotics, including cannabis. However, under the immense pressure of the United States, Rajiv Gandhi led government had passed the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act in 1985. Under the law, the government banned charas (separated resin, crude or refined), hashish (a purified form of charas), ganja (flowering or fruiting top of the cannabis plant), and any mixture with or without any natural mixture.\n\nUnder the law, the state governments got the power to permit, control, and regulate the cultivation of cannabis plants along with production, manufacture, possession, transport, inter-state import and export of the plant and its derivatives. Only the state government and its authorized personnel are allowed to cultivate the plant.\n\nIf someone is found in possession of cannabis in India, he or she can be punished for up to one year with a provision of a fine up to Rs.10,000 or both. If someone is found involved in the illegal trade of the plant, he or she can be jailed for up to ten years or fine of Rs.1,00,000 or both.\n\nLegal cultivation of hemp in India\n\nInterestingly, though the government has the provision of licensing personnel to cultivate cannabis since 1985, the first license was given in 2018. Indian Industrial Hemp Association got the first license to cultivate hemp. In an interview, the founder-president of IIHA said, \u201cWe will commence cultivation of non-narcotic hemp soon with the initial focus on creating a seed bank. The cultivation will be taken up in villages in the Pauri Garhwal region.\u201d They got permission to cultivate hemp in Uttarakhand over 1,000 hectares, on a pilot basis. At present, the company sells fibre made out of the hemp plant.\n\nHow Bhang is allowed, but marijuana is not under the law\n\nAs per the Magnitude Of Substance Use In India 2019 report, about 2.8 percent of India\u2019s population have used some form of cannabis in 2018. There is a loophole in the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act in 1985 that it only bans the usage of buds and resins. It is believed that the government intentionally kept this loophole to leave bhang, which is made out of leaves, out of the coverage under the law that would have prohibited its use even for religious purposes. The leaves of the cannabis plant contain a lesser concentration of active ingredients making it less potent in nature.\n\nAlthough bhang is not banned, the law prohibits anyone from cultivating it for commercial purposes. Though bhang is not covered under the NDPS Act, it does fall under the definition of a cannabis plant, making it a punishable act to cultivate the plant without permission from the government.\n\nCountries that have legalized cannabis\n\nCanada: In October 2018, Canada legalized the medicinal use of cannabis under the Cannabis Act. Anyone living in Canada who is above 18 years of age can keep or share up to 30 grams of cannabis in dry or non-dry form.\n\nUruguay: It was the first country to legalize cannabis in 2013 for recreational use. Buyers need to register to buy marijuana for recreational purposes. They can buy up to 10 grams of marijuana from authorized pharmacies.\n\nNorth Korea: Though the country keeps everything secret, still there are rumors that it is legal to grow cannabis in North Korea.\n\nSeveral states in the US: States including Illinois, Washington State, Oregon, Colorado, Michigan, Nevada, California, Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, and Alaska, have legalized the recreational use of marijuana. Other states may follow the suite sooner or later as per the experts.\n\nNetherlands: Cannabis can be sold in licensed coffeeshops.\n\nMedicinal use of marijuana: Countries including Argentina, Australia, Barbados, Bermuda, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador and Finland have legalized the medicinal use of marijuana.\n\nPossible legalization in India\n\nIn January 2018, the Prime Minister Office asked the health ministry to check the benefits of cannabis. The letter from PMO stated, \u201cA reply indicating the decision/action taken on the submission of the petitioner may invariably be sent to the petitioner at the earliest, preferably a month. In case it is not possible to take an action or decision on the matter, an interim reply indicating the reason be sent to the PMO and petitioner.\u201d\n\nLater in the same year, the state of Uttarakhand allowed the cultivation of hemp. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor also talked in favour of legalizing cannabis in India. In March 2020, Prasenjit Chakraborty, a BJP leader from Tripura, requested PM to consider legalizing cannabis in India. However, the recent case of Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s death has unearthed several instances where celebrities of the Indian film industry were involved in drug abuse. It is believed that the case will push back efforts of legalizing cannabis in India for some time. Also, recent studies have revealed how Pakistan is involved in narco-terrorism in India. It is one of the reasons the government may not consider legalizing cannabis any time soon.",

A protected witness confessed that Raza, along with others, \u201cspoke wrong and objectionable things against CAA, NRC and the current government, and instigated Muslims\u201d.\n\nKawalpreet Kaur, another left-wing activist\u2019s name has also been named in the disclosure statement of Saifi dated May 25, in which he said he was in touch with Kaur and others to \u201cplan with them\u201d and get them to send \u201cprovocative messages/tweets\u201d so that the \u201cMuslim community feels angered towards the government and its policies due to religious reasons\u201d.\n\nThe charge-sheet filed by the Delhi Police further said that Ishrat Jahan, in her disclosure statement, alleged that in order to sustain the anti-CAA protests, filmmaker Rahul Roy and Bhim Army member Himanshu were also invited by her and Saifi on the instructions of Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC).\n\nDelhi court admits charge-sheet filed by Delhi Police\n\nEarlier, this week, the Delhi Court admitted the charge-sheets filed by the Delhi Police against the 15 accused in the Delhi riots. In its charge-sheet, the Delhi police had alleged that the anti-Hindu Delhi riots that took place in February were the result of a pre-planned conspiracy.\n\nThe Delhi police had invoked various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) along with the Indian Penal Code in the case. The case emanates from FIR No. 59, which was lodged by Delhi Police\u2019s Crime Branch on March 6, 2020.\n\nThe Delhi Police has named 15 prime accused in the Anti-Hindu Delhi riots case that includes former Aam Aadmi Party leader Tahir Hussain, former Congress leader Ishrat Jahan, self-proclaimed activist Khalid Saifi, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar and Meeran Haider.\n\nFar-left \u2018activists\u2019 and members of Pinjra Tod members \u2013 Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal have also been named in the charge-sheet along with Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) student Asif Iqbal Tanha.",

Bilkis, one of the \u2018dadis\u2019 of anti-CAA protest site Shaheen Bagh, has been named by the Time Magazine in its list of \u2018100 Most Influential People of 2020\u2019.\n\nWriting an ode to Bilkis, Rana Ayyub, in her article, has claimed that the 82-year-old \u2018protestor\u2019 was the \u2018voice of the marginalized\u2019 in India, who would sit at a protest site from morning to midnight.\n\nContinuing her usual antics, Rana Ayyub blatantly lies that Bilkis was sitting as a mark of protests at Shaheen Bagh ever since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government passed the Citizenship Amendment Act, which \u201ccould block Muslims from citizenship in the country\u201d.\n\nRana Ayyub\u2019s article praising Bilkis that peddles blatant lies\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Islamic troll Rana Ayyub further continues saying that Bilkis, along with thousands of women who joined her in Shaheen Bagh, which according to her became the \u2018symbol of resistance in a nation\u2019 where the \u2018voices of women and minorities were being systematically drowned\u2019 out by the majoritarian politics of the Modi regime.\n\n\u201cBilkis gave hope and strength to activists and student leaders who were being thrown behind bars for standing up for the unpopular truth in a democracy that was sliding into authoritarianism, and inspired peaceful copycat protests across the country,\u201d Rana Ayyub wrote in TIME magazine profiling Bilkis.\n\nIronically, Rana\u2019s ode to Shaheen Bagh daadi has come days after the Delhi Police has submitted in court that the women at Shaheen Bagh were being paid to sit in protest, like daily wage workers.\n\nRana keeps lying blatantly about CAA\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the Citizenship Amendment Act passed by the Indian parliament has nothing to do with Indian citizens, Muslim or otherwise, as it seeks to grant citizenship to persecuted religious minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.\n\nThe CAA is a special one-time measure for the religious minorities who have already come to India after facing persecution in the three specified countries. The amendment does not cancel the existing naturalisation laws. The historic legislation does not have any provisions to repel citizenship or carry out deportation of any Indian Muslims.\n\nThe CAA doesn\u2019t even bar Muslims from anywhere in the world from applying citizenship in India through the usual way, following existing rules.\n\nHowever, Rana Ayyub resorts to openly peddle fake news on the Citizenship Amendment Act saying that the legislation \u201ccould block Muslims from citizenship in the country\u201d. Shockingly, the publications like \u2018TIME\u2019 which publishes such lies in its list of influential people across the world, failed to check the misinformation peddled by the likes of Rana Ayyub and instead provides a platform to push fake news on Indian laws.\n\nShaheen Bagh Anti-CAA protests\n\nThe anti-CAA protests, especially at Shaheen Bagh, which began as a peaceful protest crossed all the boundaries as it turned out to be another typical left-wing managed anti-India event. Eventually, the Shaheen Bagh protest site had provided fodder and a shield for violent rioters who had, in February, targeted Hindus and gone on a rampage burning the capital, timing the bloodbath with US President Trump\u2019s visit to Delhi.\n\nFollowing the failure of violent protests perpetrated by the Muslim mobs on the streets of Delhi and Jamia Millia Islamia University, few women belonging to Muslim community sat on a protest at Shaheen Bagh, blocked a bus stop and a highway causing severe problems to the public of Delhi.\n\nShaheen Bagh protests, which were initially passed off as an organic protest in a bid to \u2018save the constitution\u2019 began to turn into a blatantly communal event. It was earlier reported that the Muslim mobs had shouted pro-Pakistan and Hinduphobic slogans like \u201cJinnah Wali Azadi\u201d, demanding another partition of the country.",

    "text": "For propaganda website AltNews, whose entire existence rests on vilifying the Modi government and painting the regime as anti-Muslim, it is difficult to reconcile with the fact that some Muslims might be BJP supporters and admirers of PM Modi.\n\nWhen Muslims express their association with the BJP, RSS or any other party that is bracketed by liberals as parties with \u2018Hindutva\u2019 ideology, AltNews goes into overdrive. It denounces the Muslims who voice their support for PM Modi and his government and raising questions over their Muslimness by highlighting the fact they are associated with the RSS. Sometimes, they don\u2019t even have to support the PM. The mere fact that as a Muslim they do not hate PM Modi with all their guts is sometimes enough to lose their Muslim credentials.\n\nRecently, on PM Modi\u2019s birthday, members of Muslim community celebrated the occasion at Nizamuddin, Delhi. The event was covered by news agency ANI. However, this did not sit well with the anti-Modi propaganda website AltNews which was quick to slam ANI for presenting an RSS-backed event as \u2018Muslim community\u2019 celebrations of PM Modi\u2019s birthday.\n\nAltNews questions Muslimness of those associated with RSS/BJP\n\nThis is not a one-off incident when AltNews has called into question the faith of the Muslims who extend their support to the BJP and the RSS. In yet another instance, AltNews had published an article in which it slammed media organisations for representing Muslim women associated with RSS-affiliated organisations as Muslims. Just because the demand of the Muslim women to construct a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya did not conform to AltNews stand on the issue, it decided to cast aspersions on the Muslimness of the women.\n\nAltNews questions Muslimness of those associated with RSS\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn yet another report published in August 2018, AltNews slammed ANI and News 18 for reporting RSS-affiliated Muslim organisation as \u201cpeople in Lucknow\u201d celebrating Bakrid by cutting a cake. AltNews was perturbed that some of the Muslims abhorred the custom of sacrificing a speechless animal and were exhorting others to shun the practice. This provided a reasonable opportunity to the leftist online rag to cast doubt over the Muslimness of the people by pointing out their association with the RSS.\n\nAltNews questions Muslimness of those associated with RSS\n\nIn one of the reports published by AltNews, the so-called \u2018fact-checker\u2019, who is often found peddling fake news, Muslim women from Varanasi as quoted by ANI couldn\u2019t be authentic Muslims because they belonged to an organisation founded by a staunch BJP supporter. By this rationale, AltNews implies that no true Muslim can be a supporter of the BJP or be associated with it or its affiliate organisation.\n\nAltNews questions Muslimness of those associated with RSS\n\nFor AltNews, Muslims cease to exist as Muslims if they do not oppose the BJP and the RSS. Any association of the Muslims with the aforesaid organisations automatically raises doubts over their adherence to Islam. According to AltNews, resistance and opposition to PM Modi, BJP and its affiliate organisations is the only measure of one\u2019s Muslimness. Any Muslim who is found defying these conventions, his Muslimness is liable to be questioned by AltNews.\n\nWith its anti-Modi propaganda, AltNews seems to have assumed the role of authority to dish out the certificate of Muslimness to others. Those who conform to their propaganda against PM Modi and BJP are hailed as pious Muslims, others do not toe their propaganda are discredited and their Muslimness questioned, just because they did not share the deep-seated and intense hatred for PM Modi as harboured by the AltNews.",

    "text": "As Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) is closing down on Bollywood\u2019s connection to drug usage, several celebrities are coming under the scanner of the agency. One of the latest names that have emerged in the drug abuse case is of Deepika Padukone. Netizens have now dig out the connection between her NGO \u2018The Live Love Laugh Foundation\u2019 (TLLLF) and KWAN talent agency.\n\nTLLLF History and its connection to KWAN Entertainment\n\nTLLLF was founded in 2015 by Deepika Padukone, aimed at raising awareness about mental health. Deepika, who claims to have suffered from depression, had said that there should be a supporting ecosystem to allow a person suffering from a mental disorder to cope with hope and dignity. Though the aim of the charitable trust sounds progressive and important, especially in a country like India, where mental illness is considered to be a taboo, TLLLF\u2019s name got associated with several controversies.\n\n\u2013 Anirban Das Blah (2015-2017) [ Founder and Managing Director of CAA KWAN till 2018]\n\n\u2013 Dr Shyam Bhat (2015-present)\n\n\u2013 Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw (2016-present)\n\n\u2013 Dr Murali Doraiswamy (2018-present)\n\n\u2013 Ananth Narayanan (2019-present) pic.twitter.com/rdh0u7qKnm \u2014 Cyber Hunts (@Cyber_Hunnt) September 23, 2020\n\nAnirban Das Blah, ex-owner of KWAN Entertainment, was associated with Deepika\u2019s NGO. When his name first appeared in the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement in 2018, both KWAN and TLLLF issued a statement that they have removed Anirban from his respective positions in the organization. On 23 September, Blah\u2019s name again appeared in controversy when actress Sherlyn Chopra alleged that he sexually harassed her during a meeting. KWAN\u2019s employee Karishma and Deepika\u2019s alleged 2017 chat has recently surfaced discussing procuring drugs.\n\nNCB has also summoned Madhu Mantena Varma, co-founder of KWAN, Dhruv Chitgopekar, CEO KWAN and Jaya Saha Talent Manager KWAN who managed Sushant Singh Rajput and Rhea Chakraborty. Saha also admitted ordering CBD Oil for Rhea and Rajput.\n\nSame PAN for two NGOs\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTwitter account @cyber_hunnt also pointed out how two NGOs, TLLLF and Maa Samadhanam Educational Charitable Trust have the same PAN.\n\nSame PAN Card for 2 NGOs: TLLLF & Maa Samadhanam Educational Charitable Trust\n\nPic 1: See PAN no. for Maa Samadhanam Educational Charitable Trust\n\nLink: https://t.co/BjxMl7nB8y pic.twitter.com/ybHOYXO9OM \u2014 Cyber Hunts (@Cyber_Hunnt) September 23, 2020\n\nTLLLF PAN\n\nTLLLF too has quoted same PAN on its website.\n\nInterestingly, there is another NGO named Maa Samadhanam Educational and Charitable Trust (\u201cand\u201d being the differentiating factor) which has a different PAN.\n\nExemption detail for Maa Samadhanam Educational and Charitable Trust\n\nThe PAN of Maa Samadhanam Educational and Charitable Trust is AADTM6352J. But the PANs of both Maa Samadhanam Educational Charitable Trust and The Live Love Laugh Foundation are mentioned as same, AACTT5919M. The TLLLF has mentioned the PAN in their website, and also uploaded a copy of the PAN. On the other hand, there is no website of both the Maa Samadhanam NGOs, but their names appear in a list of exempted institutions on the website of the Income Tax department with the respcting PANs, one being same as TLLLF\u2019s PAN.\n\nCopy of PAN of TLLLF\n\nTLLLF has also uploaded the approval letters issued by the Income Tax department under sections 12A and 80G, and both the letters mention the PAN. Therefore, it can be assumed that TLLLF PAN is genuine, but there is a mystery about why another NGO has the same PAN, and why the same NGO has a different PAN under a slightly different name.\n\nFCRA Approval\n\nIn the annual report for the year 2018-2019, Anisha Padukone, Director TLLLF, mentioned that the organization applied for Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) license so that they can receive foreign funding to expand the functioning of the organization. In the next year\u2019s annual report that is of 2019-2020, it was mentioned that they had received the FCRA license in July 2019 and now eligible to receive foreign funding. The organization has not submitted its FCRA return for 2019-2020 so far; however, their audit report was included in the annual report 2019-2020.\n\nDeepika and history of controversies\n\nStatement on Rahul Gandhi: In an old video, Deepika praised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his contributions towards the nation as a youth leader. In the video, she hoped Gandhi would become PM one day and lead the nation. Her statement often surfaces over social media mocking her for her views on politics.\n\nMr. Rahul Gandhi is Ms. Deepika Padukone\u2019s choice for the PM of India, as this interview from the past shows. pic.twitter.com/tdDiB6eml6 \u2014 Atal Indians (@atalindians) September 22, 2020\n\nVisit at JNU: During anti-CAA protests, Deepika visited Jawaharlal Nehru University and supported those who were raising their voice against CAA and NRC. She also had a word with Aishe Ghosh, a student leader who was one of the persons leading the protest. There were two theories about why she went to support the protesters in a hurry. One theory suggested she was there to promote her then-soon-to-be-released movie Chappak and the other theory indicated that she was paid to do so by Aneel Mussarat.",

The records also note that some of these transactions are linked to what \u201cappears to be Eastern European prostitution or human trafficking ring.\u201d\n\nThe Senate committee report on Hunter Biden\n\nHunter got millions of dollars from Russian oligarchs\n\nThe report suggested that Biden formed significant and consistent financial relationships with the corrupt oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky. His firm made millions of dollars from that association while Joe Biden was Vice President of the US. Rosemont Seneca Thornton, an investment firm co-founded by Hunter Biden, received 3.5 million in wire transfer from Elena Baturina. It was alleged in the report that she received illegal construction contracts from her husband, who was then-mayor of Moscow.\n\nThe report also notes significant financial transactions from the Ukrainian company and other individuals to Hunter and his business partner Archer. The report says that Hunter Biden and his family members, and Archer have received millions of dollars from foreign nationals with \u2018questionable backgrounds\u2019.\n\nThe senate committee report on Hunter Biden\n\nBiden camp is yet to respond\n\nThere has been no statement from Joe Biden\u2019s camp on the report. However, his camp has accused Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Chairman of the committee that handled the investigation, of diverting attention from the mismanagement that the Trump administration has caused during the pandemic.",

    "text": "While talking to ANI, Minister of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare, Narendra Singh Tomar, said that the agriculture bills that have been recently passed in both houses would bring a revolutionary change in the lives of the farmers.\n\nHe said that during the first tenure of PM Modi in the office, the government decided to ensure a 50% increase in the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) in order to improve the financial condition of the farmers. The government took several initiatives to improve productivity and reduce the cost of farming.\n\n#WATCH: Minister of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare, Narendra Singh Tomar speaks to ANI on #FarmBills. https://t.co/WckKA1WcCI \u2014 ANI (@ANI) September 24, 2020\n\nA mission to double the income\n\nHe said that when the government announced that by 2022, they want to double the income of the farmers, several meetings were done with the states and the stakeholders to formulate the plan. As a part of the initiative, the government announced PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana under which every registered small and marginal farmer will get Rs.6000 every year divided into three instalments. Under the scheme, the government has paid Rs.93,000 crore to the farmers.\n\nThe government has decided to open 10,000 Farmer Producer Organization (FPO) centers across the country to help small and marginal farmers. The government is going to spend 6,850 crores on the scheme in five years. These centers will help them in improving their production and income. The government has also announced a 1 lakh crore infrastructure fund in the field of agriculture.\n\nWhy are new bills essential?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe union minister said that the new bills dubbed as Farmers\u2019 Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Bill, and Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Bill would help in removing the hold of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) from the market. These bills will enable the farmers to sell their produce at a higher price directly to the buyers without any middleman.\n\nThe welfare we want for farmers wouldn\u2019t have been possible without changing laws. Farmers\u2019 Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Bill, & Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Bill will be revolutionary: Agriculture Minister pic.twitter.com/5yRLLeUp58 \u2014 ANI (@ANI) September 24, 2020\n\nHe said, according to the present system, the farmer brings the produce to the market. 25-30 licensed traders hold the auction for the produce. The farmer has to sell the produce at the price they have decided. The farmers often bend down to the price the market chooses to, due to the fact that most of them cannot afford to take the produce back with them. This act will enable the farmer to sell the produce in the market or outside the market directly to the end-buyer.\n\n#WATCH Farmers have to bring produce to \u2018mandis\u2019 where 25-30 licensed traders hold auction. Then farmer is forced to sell at whatever price is fixed. New Bills give freedom to sell outside APMC \u2018mandis\u2019 at prices they deem fit, without the taxes levied there: Agriculture Minister pic.twitter.com/eRRRNPPbj7 \u2014 ANI (@ANI) September 24, 2020\n\nThe end of the state and center tax\n\nTomar said that anyone who sells the produce outside the APMC market would not have to pay tax to the centre or the state. He said that these bills should not be seen as an end to the APMC market. APMC act functions at the state level. The farmer will have the right to decide where he wants to sell the produce. He can either trade in the APMC market, or he can sell in accordance with the new reforms introduced by the central government.\n\nMSP and procurement of the produce by the government\n\nThe union minister said that the government would continue to procure the produce from the farmers. MSP has already been announced for the Rabi and Kharif crops. As soon as the Kharif crop comes to the market, the government will start the procurement procedure. He said that those who are raising questions on MSP should answer if it was a part of any law before. MSP was never a part of any law.\n\nMSP (Minimum Support Price) will continue, we have declared MSP for Kharif and Rabi crops. As soon as Kharif crop is harvested, govt procurement will begin: Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar to ANI https://t.co/meheWeKpsc \u2014 ANI (@ANI) September 24, 2020\n\nAbout contract farming\n\nWhen he was asked about the concerns where some experts suggest these bills will only work in favor of contract farming, he said they do not understand the agriculture sector itself. He said that the bills would help the small farmers in the long run as they will not be forced to bring the produce in the APMC market. They will save on the logistics as the sellers will be able to buy the produce directly from the farm.\n\nThe minister said the small formers would be able to form a group in their villages and sell their produce together. He said as the buyers will know that they produce will not reach the market, they will work on contacting the farmers to get products directly. When he was asked that there are concerns that corporate will exploit farmers, he said that bills passed give MSP guarantee at the time of sowing a crop.\n\nAlso, as per the law, the contract between the corporate and the farmer will only be for the produce and not for the land. The farmer will have the right to nullify the agreement at any stage, but the corporate cannot step out of the agreement. If there is any dispute, and the decision is in favor of the corporate, the farmer only has to pay the amount that the corporate has paid as initial payment. The cases related to any dispute between the corporate and the farmer will be handled by Sub Divisional Magistrate. As per the law, the SDM has to resolve such cases in 30-days of filing.\n\nAbout food security\n\nTomar was asked about food security during the interview. There are some concerns that, due to the lack of incentive in conventional crops, the farmers will shift to cash-crops. It will lead to a decline in the production of traditional crops that are essential, especially in the time of need, such as the current situation of the pandemic. The buffer stock is being used extensively during the Covid-19 widespread across the country.\n\nTomar said that India has a surplus of buffer stock of essential grains. India does not have enough storage capacity to store the produce. Every year tons of crops go bad due to the lack of storage capacity. Also, it is the need of time that the farmers shift to crops that utilize lesser resources to fight climate change. It will be good if farmers choose to grow crops that require a lesser amount of water and chemical fertilizers. The crops that can provide higher profit at less cost will be beneficial for the farmers.\n\nThe noise from the opposition is only a political game\n\nTowards the end of the interview, Tomar said that during his reply in the parliament houses, the opposition parties raised voice against the bill without providing any base to their objections. He said when he was asked to answer the queries of the MPs, he thought he had to talk about the bills, but the queries were just political noises and are not meant for the welfare of farmers.\n\nMore details about the bills can be read here.",

Hurt by the detailed statement of Kapil Mishra given on record, the anchor has tried to mislead the audience by ignoring the true whistle-blowers (who are protected witnesses)\u201d, the statement added.\n\nThe police also rebutted the claim made by NDTV that riots had started when Kapil Mishra was present at Maujpur. The investigation has showed that the riots and stone-pelting had started at around 11 AM on 23rd February as part of well-planned conspiracy. The first injured in the riots was admitted at hospital at 12:15 PM, while Kapil Mishra had reached Maujpur at 3.30 PM on that day. This shows that anti-CAA protestors had started attacking the public and police in the morning of 23rd February itself, before Kapil Mishra reached Maujpur.\n\n\u2018The anchor has maliciously tried to weave a fiction by hiding these facts. But NDTV\u2019s own report that the DCP was wearing anti-riot gear and stone pelting was going on, knowingly or unknowingly supports the version mentioned in the charge sheet that stone-pelting had started around 11 AM itself\u2019, the statement by Delhi Police further added.",

    "text": "A week after Facebook India snubbed a Delhi Assembly committee\u2019s summons, the social-media giant Facebook India and its vice president Ajit Mohan have filed a petition in the Supreme Court on Tuesday challenging the summons issued by the Delhi assembly\u2019s Peace and Harmony Committee.\n\nAccording to the reports, the petition filed by the Facebook in the Supreme Court against the repeated summons issued by Delhi assembly\u2019s \u2018Peace and Harmony Committee\u2019 contends that the subject matter under investigation fell within the exclusive domain of the Union government and a state legislative assembly cannot compel witnesses to appear and provide evidence on such subjects.\n\n\u201cThe Committee seeks to compel petitioner No. 1 (Ajit Mohan) to provide testimony on subjects within the exclusive domain of the Union of India. Specifically, the Committee is seeking to make a \u2018determination of the veracity of allegations levelled against Facebook\u2019 in the Delhi riots, which intrudes into subjects exclusively allocated to the Union of India,\u201d the petition said.\n\nThe plea filed in the Supreme Court also said that the summons violates the right of the petitioner to remain silent and his right to privacy, which are fundamental rights. The plead said that the summons issued by the Delhi assembly, targeting Facebook \u2013 a platform that allows users to express themselves may create a chilling effect on the free speech rights of users of the Facebook service.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe case will be heard by a three-judge bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul on Wednesday.\n\nFacebook snubs Raghav Chadha\u2019s summons\n\nEarlier on September 15, Facebook India had snubbed the summons issued by the Delhi Assembly\u2019s \u2018Peace and Harmony Committee\u2019, led by AAP\u2019s Raghav Chadha, asking them to testify before them. The summons was issued to Managing Director and Vice-President Ajit Mohan over complaints of \u2018deliberate inaction\u2019 by Facebook against alleged hate speech that \u2018culminated in the Delhi riots\u2019.\n\nIn its statement, Facebook India had declined to attend the hearing of the committee, citing that they have already testified before a Parliamentary Standing Committee in early September for \u2018safeguarding citizen\u2019s rights\u2019.\n\nThe AAP member-led committee had was first summoned Mohan on September 10 for its meeting scheduled on September 15 in connection with complaints alleging deliberate omissions and inaction by the social media company in removing hateful content and posts.\n\nThe committee had claimed it had prima facie found Facebook India of allegedly being complicit in aggravating the communal violence in north-east Delhi in February that left at least 53 people dead. It is notable here that AAP\u2019s pwn leader Tahir Hussain is one of the main accused in the riots.\n\nFollowing the snub, AAP MLA Raghav Chadha, the head of the committee, had taken offence and had labelled Facebook\u2019s action as a \u2018disregard\u2019 to the \u2018privilege\u2019 of the committee. He had informed that summons would be issued to the social media platform yet again. He alleged that Facebook is trying to hide crucial facts in connection to the riots.\n\nAlleged links between AAP and Facebook management\n\nAnkhi Das is the Public Policy Director, Facebook for India, and South & Central Asia. While the left-liberal jamaat has accused her of being a \u2018BJP agent\u2019, her old Facebook posts tell a different story. When the Aam Aadmi Party had shared a \u2018Jhaadu Dance\u2019 video prior to the Lok Sabha elections, Ankhi Das had dubbed it as a \u2018cool campaign\u2019.\n\nMoreover, writing an opinion piece in the Daily-O titled, \u201cThe battle for Delhi on Facebook\u201d, she had praised the Facebook campaign of the Aam Aadmi Party. Ankhi wrote, \u201cMuch like they did in the December 2013 Delhi elections, the Aam Aadmi Party had a much stronger ground game. Its street power merged seamlessly with its campaign strategies on Facebook.\u201d\n\nWhile suggesting that the BJP took its voters for granted, she insinuated, \u201cThe AAP\u2019s success shows that no party \u2013 no matter how popular \u2013 can take the electorate or a good online strategy for granted.\u201d",

They also compared the current situation in the electronic media in the country with the \u201cNazi Germany\u201d. The petition says that certain news anchors and \u201cpeddlers of hate speech\u201d should not be given the benefit of freedom of speech.\n\nThe plea states that the late Congress leader Tyagi was an unfortunate victim of a \u2018hate speech\u2019 during a TV debate and that his wife Sangeeta Tyagi has \u201cwitnessed and suffered the irredeemable consequences of hate speech\u201d.

    "text": "The other day, while hearing the Sudarshan News case, the Hon. Justice K M Joseph of the Supreme Court made the following observation about the way debates are conducted on television:\n\n\u201cCertain channels mute panelists when they express views which go against the anchor\u2019s views. This is unfair.\u201c\n\nThis made me wonder. Which channel is the Hon. Justice K M Joseph watching? It also made me smile. Because it is always reassuring to know of an ordinary human side to someone as eminent as His Highness Justice K M Joseph. Turns out eminent people can be a little bit like us. Who knew?\n\nSpeaking of news channels, we have to talk about Arnab. They say Arnab is loud, they say his show is chaotic and you can barely hear anything. They are right.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOn the other extreme, there is Ravish Kumar. Ah! NDTV : the one true channel of Indian liberalism. The sweetly pessimistic voice of Ravish Kumar, night after night, telling us how everything went wrong since Sonia Gandhi lost power.\n\nWhich is better? I know liberals are rolling their eyes right now. How can you even compare the Magsaysay winning Ravish Kumar to Arnab? Seriously? Haven\u2019t you heard that Arnab has destroyed Indian journalism? The other day a liberal who probably made a ton of money as a once frequent guest on Arnab\u2019s show referred to his channel as a \u201cgutter.\u201d\n\nIt has to be true. Arnab has destroyed Indian journalism. With his support for nationalism and communal agendas. You can hear all about this from Indian liberals explaining this to Al Jazeera, the official mouthpiece of the Islamic theocracy of Qatar.\n\nBut let us think again about what Justice Joseph said. There is indeed something that just feels wrong, sort of undemocratic about a TV channel muting a panelist when they don\u2019t agree with the anchor. These TV channels are privately owned, so there isn\u2019t much of a free speech argument. And yet, as citizens of a democracy, it just \u201cfeels\u201d wrong to watch somebody being stopped from speaking, isn\u2019t it?\n\nSo why is there shouting on Arnab\u2019s show but no shouting on Ravish Kumar\u2019s show? Because there is something in Arnab\u2019s show that Ravish Kumar never has: an opposing voice.\n\nHe may shout over it. But it\u2019s there. In fact, he has to pay these panelists to come to his show and disagree with him. However you look at it, there is something honorable about that. Something democratic. Like our nation itself.\n\nTake our Lok Sabha \u2013 the house of the people. Often times, it is chaotic. Members interrupt each other. There is shouting. There is sloganeering. Often times, members break all rules of decorum and burst into the well of the house. Sometimes, they say things that are downright abusive.\n\nAnd just like Arnab\u2019s show, the outcome of these Lok Sabha \u201cdebates\u201d is never in doubt. We always know which side has the numbers. That side always wins. And yet, it is important to have the opposition and the government in the Lok Sabha, facing each other, if only to shout.\n\nYou can complain about the tone and quality of the Lok Sabha debate. But would you do away with the ritual of it? Sure, it would be better if members didn\u2019t shout. But would you ever replace it with the Chinese way?\n\nIn China\u2019s parliament, known as the Great Hall of the People, nobody ever shouts or screams. Nobody ever disagrees. I mean the President of China comes in, issues his orders and everyone applauds.\n\nRemind you of Ravish Kumar\u2019s show? One man, one view. Sometimes, \u201cguests\u201d come in, only to tell him that he is right.\n\nThe China model? You can hear what Ravish Kumar is saying. You are simultaneously reminded that your place is never to speak, but only to listen. There is never a conflict or disagreement and Ravish never has to mute any panelist for disagreeing with him.\n\nWhich do you prefer? The Arnab model of chaos and conflict? Or the Ravish Kumar model of \u201cone true journalist\u201d? Which one appeals to your democratic spirit?\n\nI will tell you my preference. I prefer the Republic of Arnab to the \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic\u201d of Ravish Kumar.\n\nEveryone knows that Arnab has the highest TRPs. The smart people insist that is because most people are dumb. Have they considered this : perhaps people tune in to Arnab\u2019s show because the format appeals to their democratic spirit? Our way may be loud and inefficient, but we Indians are a free people. The China model does not appeal to us.\n\nWhen I shared these views on Twitter the other day, some liberal friends pointed out that I am being unfair. They said to me that Ravish Kumar has an open invitation for PM Modi to come to his show any time and disagree with him.\n\nIf that is true, I guess Ravish Kumar does allow people to disagree with him on air. To have that honor, you just have to be the Prime Minister of India.\n\nFor that matter, the Chinese government does make exceptions to their no disagreements rule : it allows countries like US, India and Japan to operate embassies in Beijing. Maybe that means China is also a democracy. I do apologize to China. I also apologize to Ravish Kumar.",

    "text": "The Rajya Sabha has passed The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020 on Wednesday. It was passed by the Lok Sabha a day earlier. The Bill was opposed strongly by the opposition parties and \u2018civil society organisations\u2019. However, the Bill has been passed by both houses of the Parliament.\n\nParliament passes The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020, that will regulate foreign funding of NGOs \u2014 Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) September 23, 2020\n\nA copy of the bill is available at PRS India\u2019s site. We present a small analysis of the implications of the key changes brought about by this bill.\n\nAmendment Public servants as defined in Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code are not allowed to take contributions First Order Implication Court officers, academics in Government institutions/Universities, people on boards of statutory bodies set up by the Government of India or State Governments will have to relinquish their positions in FCRA NGOs. Many such individuals will lose a good source of alternate income and budgets and grants beyond their official academic capacity.However, there is nothing to prevent public servants from being associated with foreign funded NGOs before and after their tenure. This rule only restricts holding both concurrently. Second Order Implication Positions in statutory bodies and in quasi-Government bodies (say, Women/Child Commission) will lose their attraction. The Government may have to rationalise positions and bodies to account for lower availability of people. Deprived of FCRA income, individuals in such positions may engage in malpractice and utilisation of their position for illegal gratification Workarounds Non-FCRA organisations will have public servants on board. The same organisation will have a representative in a FCRA NGO, i.e, the public servant controls by proxy. FCRA NGOs can be run through benamis (albeit with additional costs/risks) Gotchas Look for individuals of ages above 35 that have never filed a IT return and who are added to boards of FCRA NGOs \u2013 it is possible it is a domestic help or car driver of an ousted individual. Look for spouses and children/parents of ousted individuals who are added to the board Table 1\n\nAmendment FCRA funds cannot be transferred to other organizations but must be spent directly by the organization involved. First Order Implication Organisations must build their own delivery capacity and not rely on implementation partners.In 2012, the intra-India transfer magnitude was ~10% of total inflow. With increase in the number of FCRA-NGOs in Delhi (total~4500 Crore),the percentage could have risen to 20% now. i.e., ~Rs. 3500 Crore of transfers to be affected. Many large entities, specifically agencies of the Roman Catholic Church, send large sums to official Catholic bodies, which are further disbursed to more than 700 organisations across India.Fund-raisers, ie, the sales end and implementation specialists, would merge instead of remaining separate. Pure play fund-raisers may be affected, as foreign players will cut out middlemen in favour of working directly with ground level NGOs. Many individuals have multiple FCRA entities in play, with fund flows between them. These will have to be consolidated. Second Order Implication We foresee a lot of redundancy in positions in larger entities.This will affect some large entities in Delhi, which have been liaising with donors abroad and coordinating the disbursal of funds across India. With this new rule, they will turn into pure administrative cost centers and thus becomes nonviable. Workarounds Various smaller organisations will be opened as for-profit entities and will operate based on contracts from FCRA NGOs. Larger International NGOs will establish Liaison Offices in Delhi, themselves and will coordinate their activities with the FCRA-NGOs all across the country, sidestepping the big Delhi players Gotchas Look for commonalities between directorships and FCRA NGO functionaries and fund flows between them to identify conflicts of interest and round-tripping of funds. Table 2\n\nAmendment Administrative expenses to be restricted to 20% of inflow First Order Implication Many entities have been supporting individuals for activities such as soft conversions, funding judicial and political and accounting for these expenses under administrative heads. Their operations will be affected. Pay cuts and redundancies across the board are to be expected. Full time positions will be transitioned to contracts. Reduction in rental expenses. More money will be diverted towards purchase of property and towards setting up fixed deposits and line of credit to pay administrative staff Second Order Implication Increase in travel, conference and research grant expenses is to be expected as an alternate means of income for personnel Workarounds None Gotchas Travel and conference expenses of more than 20 lakhs per annum are to be reviewed against receiptsUtilization of funds for advancing line of credit and as collateral to open businesses. Table 3\n\nAmendment Primary inflow is to be through a SBI branch in New Delhi First Order Implication All remittance transactions can be intimated to MHA through the PFMS on a real-time basis. Similarly, all withdrawals can be intimated to MHA on a real-time basis Second Order Implication A dedicated team can be placed at the branch to service FCRA accounts and to help them manage fund flows The centralisation of inflow transactions will also enable tracking of the source of fund flows. It will be possible to trace funds back to source, cross-verify with source organisation\u2019s tax filings to prevent malfeasance.The process of filing FC4-returns can be simplified. An online tool can show the user a list of remittance and withdrawal transactions. The purpose, source and beneficiary needs to be marked by the filer against each transaction for simple consolidation and return filing. Workarounds The money can be transferred to other utilization accounts for further usage. Gotchas Same entity using multiple accounts for remittances Table 4\n\nAmendment Section 12 of FCRA 2010 specifies a list of conditions for grant of certificate of registration. The same conditions shall be applied at the time of renewal of registration also. First Order Implication The registration is to be renewed every 5 years. Earlier, there was no specific requirement for fresh scrutiny at the time of renewal. Any entity found in violation of FCRA rules can now be restricted from renewal of registration and will have to undergo scrutiny afresh. Second Order Implication Renewals of registration will become as rigorous as initial grant. Workarounds None Gotchas Creation of a new Trust/Foundation or Section 8 Company for renwal if an entity is found in violation. Table 5\n\nWhile listing the gotchas and workarounds for the earlier amendments, we will now begin to appreciate the new requirement to furnish Aadhar of key functionaries in all registered entities. Without this kind of knowledge of persons, none of the amendments can be effective. When KYC norms are applicable, it is equally important to implement a KYB (Know Your Beneficiary) norm.\n\nWhile it is expected that these regulations will be onerous, here is a background:\n\nLess than 500 organizations hold 50% of cash and 50% of the inflows 90% of the cash is held by 2500 organizations and 90% of the inflow is covered by 3600 organizations There are not more than 3000 organizations that receive more than Rs 1 crore in annual inflow\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nScrutiny needs to be focused on these organisations. There is a vast number of FCRA organisations \u2013 10,000 odd \u2013 which do not receive more than 20 lakhs per annum. Care should be taken that these regulations are not used to harass and extract illegal gratification from these small organisations.\n\nThe analysis was co-authored with @by2kaafi.",

The entire region is designated as an ecologically fragile under the Environment (Protection) Act.\n\nThe worrying issue was that the Church had established boards and an arch in the forest area claiming it as a Christian pilgrimage centre.

    "text": "An old woman in Pakistan who was separated from her family during the partition, was abducted and converted to Islam, has finally united with her family in India over a phone call. According to a report of Indian Express, the 86-years old woman named Daphia Bai alias Aisha, who was separated from her family when she was 13, talked to her nephews and grandsons over a video call. Daphia could not hold back her tears as she saw her family for the first time since partition. She desperately started kissing the screen of the phone as the pictures of her family members appeared on it.\n\nDaphia\u2019s family lives in Morkhana town of Bikaner, Rajasthan. A translator helped her talk to her family as she spoke in Saraiki while her family spoke in Marwari. She said that the had spent all her life crying. She narrated how she tried to trace her family by offering people ghee to help her. In all these years, Daphia remembered the names of her siblings and that the place where her family lived had a lot of peacocks.\n\nThis information helped in tracing Daphia\u2019s family. A Pakistani YouTuber Muhammad Alamgir had shared a video of Daphia last year asking if anyone knew anything about her family. Alamgir came to know about her from his friend Munawwar Ali Sheikh who knew Daphia\u2019s grandson Naseer Khan.\n\nKidnapped and Converted after Partition\n\nHer family belonged to the Meghwal caste and used to shuttle between Bikaner and the part of Punjab which went to Pakistan after partition. After partition, her family chose to stay in Bikaner. But she was kidnapped, converted to Islam and married off. She gave birth to seven children. However, she kept looking for her family all these years. Daphia\u2019s grandson said that she used to say that her siblings\u2019 names were Alsu, Chothu and Mira and that her home town had a lot of peacocks. He said that she used to talk about her mamu\u2019s (maternal uncle) wedding that she had attended.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe video of her story shared by Alamgir was spotted a by a Delhi-based man named Zaid Muhammad Khan. after watching the video, Khan decided to search for Daphia\u2019s family. He shared her story on Facebook with some people in Bikaner particularly in Morkhana which he guessed since she used to talk about peacocks at her place. He even skimmed through publicly available revenue records looking for her siblings.\n\nKhan came in contact with a person named Bharat Singh who runs a shop in Morkhana. Singh started looking for Meghwal families who had lost many members during the partition. Finally, in the second week of September, he traced a family in Morkhana who had heard their elders talk about a sister who had gone missing during the partition. They searched for her for years. The family members of her sibling Chotu made a WhatsApp video call to her. The grandchildren of her siblings were elated to see her. The families exchanged photographs on phone.\n\nDaphia has lost all her children except two daughters. With growing age, her desire to find her family grew stronger. According to her grandson Naseer, she used to keep repeating the name of Morkhana. Around 20 years ago, her family had taken her to Yazman Tehsil in Bahawalpur district in Pakistan wherein some Meghwal families still lived. He used to say that the elder members in that family would tell her that they were her brothers thinking that this would console her. They would even visit her in her town in Mailsi.\n\nShe was Sold for an Ox\n\nDaphia had put out an advertisement in a local Urdu newspaper on Pakistan\u2019s Independence Day, narrating how she was sold in exchange for an ox. \u201cI belonged to a Hindu family.

    "text": "The Indian online gaming industry is growing at an exponential rate. The user-centric approach has been recognized as one of the fundamental factors of the increasing adaptability and usability of online games. The KPMG X Google report \u201cOnline Gaming in India: Reaching a New Pinnacle\u201d shows that the Indian online gaming industry is about to add 190 million gamers and become a USD one billion opportunity by 2021, from USD 290 million in 2016.\n\nThe advent of the digital age has revolutionized the gaming industry. The internet has opened the door to a whole new realm of opportunities for this industry and multiplied the number of players. There has been a constant legal battle between the game of skills and games of chance. A game is classified as a skill game or game of chance/luck on the basis of the outcome of the game. If the result predominantly depends on the skill of the player and not on chance, the game is considered legal and playing it for cash, as well as free, is legally allowed.\n\nUnderstanding the \u201cGame of Skill\u201d\n\nAccording to the law, a game of skill is one in which success depends predominantly on superior knowledge, training, attention, experience, adroitness, personal attributes, and capabilities of the player. The skill and expertise of the player play a dominant role in determining the outcome of the game. Among the various games of skill, the card game rummy has gained vast popularity in India. Popular online gaming operators like Junglee Rummy have added more exciting features to the game with the changing time to cater to the needs and wishes of millions of players.\n\nEmbracing the challenging times, mobile game operators are moving towards more value-driving products. With an increased focus on local development, the user-behavior has become the main focus for developing new skill-based games. The advancement in technology and the easy availability of cheap network services have made mobile devices a favorite medium for players. The advantage of playing games on the mobile is taking the player to the next level. India is rapidly moving towards improved age and gender parity among online gamers. Given the current situation, the majority will continue to play on mobile phones in 2021.\n\nIndian Skill Gamers \u2013 how operators keep them engaged\n\nIndia is a young country with about half of its population under the age of 25. A user-centered approach is fundamental in the usability of an app or gaming platform. Platforms like Junglee Rummy focus on the product and keep the user engaged through different attractions. The regular cash and free tournaments on their rummy app ensure that players stay entertained and engaged.\n\nGamers play and stay engaged with online games for specific needs such as productive entertainment, socializing, skill enhancement, and much more. Initially players used to play online games for just entertainment and took to online gaming for a change from their routine. But eventually social communities of gamers started building and people started playing for social interaction. They make new friends and socialize over games. Online games have become a means to connect with like-minded people.\n\nWith the increasing number of online players and online game operators, the thrill of competing, winning and acquiring high status in the community of gamers has become a big attraction. Junglee Rummy understood the pain points of users and made sure that their games work smoothly even with a low speed internet connection and can be played on almost all the smartphones/tablets, as well as computers and laptops. The easy accessibility, seamless user interface, and 24X7 customer support by Junglee Rummy ensure that gamers never get stuck anywhere and all their problems are solved in no time.\n\nSkill Games X Junglee Rummy\n\nAs discussed above, growth in the country\u2019s gaming industry is being fuelled by enhanced connectivity, changing ways of social interaction, and a growing young population. Junglee Rummy closely associated itself with the local players and created online rummy contests to celebrate every small event with them. Special events and tournaments were organized during all the popular Indian festivals, such as Holi, Diwali, Christmas, Republic Day, Independence Day, etc. to add more spark to the festivity and the spirit of gaming.\n\nA strong and booming Junglee Rummy community of over 12 million registered users is the embodiment of Junglee Rummy\u2019s success as India\u2019s most trusted online rummy platform. As the trend of online gaming increases, Junglee Rummy keeps enhancing the gaming experience it offers.\n\nThe fierce competition among game operators gives the ever-expanding user base a wide range of choices. To stay in tune with the growing user-base and increasing expectations of players, a deep understanding of the behavior and personas of skill gamers is essential. Only constant improvement and catering to changing player preferences can ensure continued user engagement.",

    "text": "On 16th September, the offices of Theo Connect private limited, that owns the NW News Network, were raided by the Income Tax department. According to HW News, the raid went on for more than 50 hours, and mobile phones of the journalists were seized by the officials. HW News is a little-known digital news outfit, most known for employing Vinod Dua, the controversial pro-Congress journalist who is accused of stalking and sexually harassing filmmaker Nishtha Jain.\n\nThe exact reasons for the raid, and its outcome, are not known at present. But a cursory study on the financials of Theo Connect do raise doubts about its state of affairs. The company is not performing very well, but it still seems to able raise funds with ease. The paid-up capital of the company is Rs 5 lakhs, and its directors are Ganesh Jagtap and Siddhant Jagtap. Sujit Nair is the managing director of the company, who originally owned it, but later sold it to Ganesh Jagtap. Vinod Dua is the consulting editor of the digital news network, and he runs a program called the \u2018The Vinod Dua Show\u2019 on the network.\n\nAccording to the financial statement of the company accessed by OpIndia, its revenue in the financial year 2017-18 was Rs 54 lakh, which nosedived to Rs 28 lakh in the year 2018-19. The company suffered a loss of Rs 2.95 crore in that year, up from a loss of Rs 1.98 crore the previous year.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s revenue was just Rs 28 lakh in the year 2018-19, its expenses were Rs 3.23 crores. It means the expenses were more than eleven times the revenue, clearly a vey bad position. Even if one considers that revenues can\u2019t match expenses for start-ups during initial years, the worrying fact is that the major source of fund for Theo Connect seems to be debt, not equity.\n\nFinances of Theo Connect (amounts in Rs)\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn the year 2018-19, the company managed unsecured loans amounting to Rs 3.09 crore. With the existing loans of Rs 1.87 crores, the company\u2019s total loans at the end of the year stood at Rs 4.96 crore, a very high amount for revenue of just Rs 28 lakh.\n\nIt makes little sense as to how the company with such poor financial performance manages expenses of more than \u20b93 crore, and even manages to raise funds in the form of unsecured loans. It seems the entire expense of the company is paid by raising unsecured loans, as the company earned a very meagre revenue.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that a bulk this unsecured loan of Rs 3.09 crore came from a company called Dream TAG Realty Private Limited, a company with the same directors as Theo Connect. The revenue of Dream TAG was just Rs 94 thousand in the year 2018-19, down from Rs 34.85 lakh. It reported a loss of Rs 35.78 lakh in that year. Therefore, it is a mystery how the company managed to give crores in unsecured loans when its financials are not that healthy.\n\nGanesh Jagtap was a was a bureaucrat from Maharashtra, and has been a Press Secretary to the Deputy Chief Minister of the State. His other company Dream Tag Realty is a Mumbai based Project Management, Real Estate and Infrastructure Company.\n\nTherefore, it is a mystery how HW News Network is operating with expenses that is almost six times its revenues. Further, it manages unsecured loans from entities with similar financial positions. With the raids by Income Tax department in its offices, it is expected that the source of its dubious funds will be known.",

    "text": "Former IPS officer Julio Ribeiro has been in the news recently over a letter that had been written to the Delhi Police regarding their supposedly flawed investigation into the communal riots that occurred in Delhi in the month of February. Ribeiro questioned the Police\u2019s supposed lack of action against \u201cBJP stalwarts\u201d while \u2018doubting the patriotism\u2019 of \u201ctrue patriots\u201d such as Harsh Mander and Delhi University professor Apoorvanand.\n\nTo be clear, Harsh Mander, who Julio Ribeiro calls a \u201ctrue patriot\u201d, is a member of an Italian organisation that works closely with the Italian government and its secret services in order to help them achieve their foreign policy objectives. In addition to this, Mander is also closely associated with George Soros, the American Billionaire who has declared war upon nationalists and nationalism, including Prime Minister Modi.\n\nThus, it is quite evident that Ribeiro\u2019s definition of a \u2018true patriot\u2019 may not be entirely consistent with the dictionary definition of it, or how the term is understood in popular culture. As it so happens, Julio Ribeiro is part of a collective that calls itself the \u2018Constitutional Conduct Group\u2019 (CCG). The primary objective of CCG appears to be composing open letters in order to build undue pressure upon institutions.\n\nIn every open letter that it releases, CCG states, \u201cWe are a group of former civil servants belonging to the All India and Central Services who have worked with the Central Government as well as different State Governments of India. As a group, we have no affiliation with any political party but believe in being neutral, impartial and committed to the Constitution of India.\u201d Interestingly, however, every single time, their open letters endorse political positions that lie on the liberal end of the political spectrum.\n\nSudarshan News Open Letter\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe CCG has written an open letter to the Home Minister, Chairman of the UPSC, Minorities Commission, and other authorities demanding action against Sudarshan News for what it called a \u2018malicious campaign to promote hatred and divisiveness in society\u2019. Consequently, the letter said, \u201cWe, therefore, urge the Union Home Ministry, the Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi, the Chief Minister, Delhi and the Commissioner of Police, Delhi to order the lodging of FIRs under the relevant legal provisions.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cWe also request the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the News Broadcasting Standards Authority of India to investigate whether or not the show would run afoul of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, read with the Cable Television Networks Rules 1994, and the Code of Ethics and Broadcasting Standards and take suitable action.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Human Rights Commission, the Minorities Commission, and the Union Public Service Commission are also requested to take notice of this vicious hate campaign to malign a particular religion and community through the propagation of slanted news that will not stand scrutiny by any objective criterion,\u201d it stated. Among others, the letter was signed by Harsh Mander, former NSA Shivshankar Menon and Julio Ribeiro himself. Other than Mander, Menon also sits on the Board of Trustees of an organisation with George Soros.\n\nFacebook Open Letter\n\nThere was some controversy recently over the conduct of one of Facebook India employees who was accused of unfairly favouring the Bharatiya Janata Party. While it was evident from the beginning that the allegations levelled at Ankhi Das were politically motivated, the CCG composed an open letter on that as well and decided to pile up the pressure on Facebook. The open letter addressed to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was penned on the 24th of August.\n\nThe open letter stated, \u201c\u2026we are surprised that Facebook did not take action against some clear and serial offenders in India \u2013 persons like T Raja Singh and a few others \u2013 for their derogatory comments against people belonging to a different religion, accusing Muslims of spreading Covid 19, indulging in \u2019love jehad\u2019 and various other misdemeanours. What is striking about Facebook\u2019s leniency towards these persons is that all of them happen to be members of the political party in power.\u201d\n\nIt continued, \u201cWe are writing to you in the expectation that you will make serious efforts to audit the implementation of Facebook\u2019s hate speech policy in India and, while such an audit is under way, ensure that the present Public Policy Head of Facebook, India, is not in a position to influence the investigations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also fervently hope that in future, you will not let your company\u2019s business prospects stand in the way of implementing your own policy against hate speech and posts which can lead to hate crimes. This is a sure way of demonizing minorities and inflicting violence upon them while undermining the democratic and secular basis of the Indian Constitution,\u201d it added.\n\nUnlike the Sudarshan News open letter which was signed by 91 individuals, this was signed by only 54. However. Harsh Mander and Julio Ribeiro did appear on the list of signatories apart from a few others who appear to be regulars.\n\nStatement on the Rule of Law and Article 19 of Indian Constitution\n\nThe CCG issued a statement on the 4th of July that \u201carises from our deep concern at the assault on the Rule of Law in India and on its citizens\u2019 rights to free speech and dissent, basic elements of any democracy.\u201d In that statement as well, the CCG made a valiant defence of its ideological compatriots such as Harsh Mander and Kafeel Khan and relied on like-minded individuals such as Amartya Sen to bolster their argument.\n\nIt said in its letter, \u201cThe rampant erosion of the rule of law in evidence today militates against the actualization of the freedom of speech which is the cornerstone of democratic functioning. The gulf between the Rule of Law rhetoric and reality is getting wider and wider. The police establishments across the country appear to have become proxies for the respective ruling parties.\u201d\n\nIn the statement, they defended \u2018Urban Naxals\u2019 such as Gautam Navlakha, who has links to Pakistan\u2019s ISI, and Sudha Bharadwaj, Shoma Sen and Anand Teltumbde as well as \u2018hundreds of political activists\u2019 in Kashmir. Siddharth Varadarajan, who is in the dock for spreading fake news about UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, was also defended by the collective of \u2019eminent citizens\u2019. The letter had 99 signatories.\n\nDefence of Harsh Mander\n\nCCG came out in strong defence of the Italian Secret Services linked \u2018activist\u2019 Harsh Mander. In an open letter to the media, that was signed by Julio Ribeiro, Soros-aide Shivshankar Menon and others, the collective claimed that the \u2018activist\u2019 was being unfairly vilified and claimed that his incendiary speech on the 16th of December was \u2018mischaracterised\u2019.\n\nThe letter said, \u201cWe are writing to you to please consider whether you can bring to the notice of the general public the continued misrepresentation and mischaracterization of his speech at Jamia Millia on December 16, 2019, and the possible misuse of law against a champion of non-violence and believer in the rule of law. In the meanwhile, those political leaders who publicly used hate speech and incited violence roam free with impunity.\u201d\n\nCampaign against CAA-NRC-NPR\n\nIn yet another open letter, this time signed by over a hundred individuals, the collective called for the repeal of the Citizenship Amendment Act and provided a lengthy explanation of why CAA-NRC-NPR is not necessary. The letter was addressed to the citizens of India but it was not ready by too many Indians outside of their echo-chamber. It is unlikely that it would have changed anyone\u2019s mind either.\n\nThe open letter stated, \u201cThe provisions of the CAA, coupled with rather aggressive statements over the past few years from the highest levels of this government, rightly cause deep unease in India\u2019s Muslim community, which has already faced discrimination and attacks on issues ranging from allegations of love jihad to cattle smuggling and beef consumption.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat the Muslim community has had to face the brunt of police action in recent days only in those states where the local police is controlled by the party in power at the centre only adds credence to the widespread feeling that the NPR-NRIC exercise could be used for selective targeting of specific communities and individuals,\u201d it added.\n\nThe letter also raised concerns about the \u201cconstitutional validity of the CAA provisions, which we also consider to be morally indefensible.\u201d It continued, \u201cAbove all, we see a situation developing where India is in danger of losing international goodwill and alienating its immediate neighbours, with adverse consequences for the security set-up in the sub-continent. India also stands to lose its position as a moral beacon guiding many other countries on the path to liberal democracy.\u201d\n\nApart from demanding a repeal of the CAA, the open letter demanded the repeal of \u201cSections 14A and 18 (2) (ia) of the Citizenship Act, 1955, pertaining to the issue of national identity cards and its procedures and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003 in its entirety\u201d and the withdrawal of \u201cthe Foreigners (Tribunals) Amendment Order, 2019\u201d and \u201cinstructions for construction of detention camps.\u201d\n\nOther Open Letters\n\nBy this point, readers would have realised that Julio Ribeiro and his band of \u2019eminent citizens\u2019 love writing and signing open letters. Apart from the ones mentioned here, the CCG has written open letters on a variety of political issues, always siding with the left. The collective penned an open letter on Ram Janmabhoomi on the 6th of December 2019.\n\nOn December 5, it penned a letter on supposed irregularities in the conduct of the Lok Sabha Elections of 2019. In October the same year, CCG wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the \u2018victimization\u2019 of \u2018honest civil servants\u2019. On the 24th of April, an open letter was penned against the candidature of Sadhvi Pragya Thakur from Bhopal.\n\nOn and on the open letter saga goes. It does not appear to have had any impact on anything significant as of yet; however, it could not be blamed on a lack of effort.",

Carlson said that the Left liberals were placing an attributing undue significance to her dying wish.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nGinsburg\u2019s dying wish, according to liberals, was that she should not be replaced until the next President is elected. What Carlson was trying to highlight was that even if Ginsburg was the greatest of the judges, her last words or wish cannot substitute a constitutional procedure. The President is constitutionally empowered to make a nomination to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court.\n\nCarlson also raised questions on the claims that Ginsburg had a last wish about the filling of the vacant Supreme Court seat saying that it was a pathetic wish if it was true at all. He flashed the social media posts of various Left liberals including scholars and journalists who threatened to start a riot or burn the whole country down if President Trump followed the constitutional procedure and made a nomination to fill the Supreme Court seat.\n\nSome of the tweets by Democrats threatened to protest at the house of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Some people actually gathered outside McConnell\u2019s house to protest following the tweets. According to Carlson, the protesters then surrounded the house of Senator Lindsey Graham to make their point.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Ginsburg\u2019s death, liberals had threatened to riot and \u2018burn the whole thing down\u2019 if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump had their way. They had also threatened to \u2018shut down\u2019 the country. The threats came on the face of continued riots that have been underway ever since the death of George Floyd. Under such circumstances, Brian Stelter pretending that Tucker Carlson is exaggerating the threat posed by left-wing violence comes across as a desperate attempt to save face for Democrats.",

    "text": "In October 2019, PM Modi said, \u201cWhen our neighbour could not succeed in its nefarious designs by sending terrorists and weapons, it hatched a conspiracy to smuggle drugs into our country to destroy our youth.\u201d In 2018, Punjab CM Amrinder Singh, while talking about the drug problem in Punjab, said, \u201cPakistan has a long-term plan of destroying our youth. They are trying to demolish the youth along the border.\u201d He was referring to seizures of hundreds of kilograms of drugs in Gujarat, and Jammu & Kashmir that was, according to him, were intended for Punjab.\n\nNeither the drug problem in India nor Pakistan\u2019s role in pushing drugs in India is new. Drug usage in border areas, especially Punjab, has increased exponentially in recent years. However, in the last few years, the instances and quantity of drugs being seized have increased exponentially. In the recent case of drug connection with Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s death, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) Director Rakesh Asthana said that they had found connections to international drug racket linked to Dubai and terror organizations. He stated, \u201cDrugs were procured for rave parties, and the funds were used for narco-terrorism.\u201d\n\nWhat is narco-terrorism?\n\nNarco-terrorism as a word was first used in the 1980s in the US when the drug smugglers in Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Nicaragua, and other Central American started using the illegal trade as a profession. Their impact on the economy in the region was so deep that they virtually ran the parallel government. The US became the largest consumer of the produced drugs, and the country is still struggling with the problem.\n\nAccording to Kshitij Prabha, Principal at Russell Square International College, Narco-terrorism can be defined as the nexus between narcotics and terrorism. Prabha published a paper \u2018Narco-Terrorism and India\u2019s Security\u2019 during her tenure as Associated Fellow, IDSA, in which she discussed the role of neighbouring countries, specifically Pakistan, in pushing drugs in India. In her paper, she referred to the Golden Crescent, which is a \u201cslice of the opium-producing area that cuts across Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan (Sanker Sen, Heroin Trafficking in the Golden Crescent).\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn 1999, Pakistan and Afghanistan produced around 6000 metric tons of drugs. It is a major security concern for India as it acts as a major source of funding for Pak-sponsored terrorism in India. It is much easier for the terror organizations to raise funds for terror activities in Indian territories using drug money as the price tag is almost a hundred times more compared to the production cost. Also, the price differs exponentially in international markets. For example, one kilogram of heroin from the Golden Crescent that costs around one lakh to produce may sell for anywhere between Rs 30 lakh to one crore depending on the market.\n\nOne of the most notable uses of drug money and drug trafficking routes in terror operations in India was the 1993 terrorist attacks in Mumbai in which the Dawood Ibrahim gang was involved. It was found that the explosives used in the terror attack were brought to India using the same routes that the Dawood gang used to smuggle people, arms, and contraband. According to a report in Times of India, a US Congressional report described D-company as a criminal syndicate operation comprised of over 5,000 members active mainly in Pakistan, India, and the United Arab Emirates. The report suggested that it has a strategic alliance with ISI and has relationships with Islamists, including Lashkar-e-Taiba and al-Qaida.\n\nImportance of tracking the drug-routes\n\nIndia has been a victim of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism for decades. There have been several instances where drugs originated from Pakistan have been seized in India. Pakistan\u2019s government in collaboration with the ISI is using narcotics to fund terrorism in India. In 1994, during an interview, Pakistan\u2019s former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said that Pakistan\u2019s army chief and the head of its intelligence agency (ISI) proposed a detailed plan to use the heroin trade to fund military operations in 1991. Sharif added that though he disapproved of the \u201cplan,\u201d he had no source to verify if the ISI obeyed his orders or not. The neighboring country is also exploiting the religious sentiments of the Muslims in the bordering states of Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. ISI often lures the economically backward Muslim population of these states for easy movement of drugs into different states of India that further helps in funding terrorism.\n\nSiegfried O. Wolf in \u2018Pakistan\u2019s bigger plans of narco-terrorism\u2019 said that in the last years, it had established smuggling networks across India, especially in the Kashmir Valley. The network helps in a steady supply of weapons and narcotics. After the major terrorist attacks in Uri and Pulwama, India increased security measures that resulted in the suspension of traditional smuggling routes. Pakistan shifted its concentration to other land-based trafficking routes via Punjab and Gujarat. Border Security forces have seized several consignments on the India-Pakistan border that contained both weapons and narcotics.\n\nAccording to the World Drug Report of 2010, India had 871,000 heroin users and 674,000 opium users in 2009. By 2018, according to a survey conducted by Atul Ambekar et al. under the Ministry Of Social Justice And Empowerment, about 2.1% of the country\u2019s population (2.26 crore individuals) used opioids. It is impossible to prevent drug usage without understanding the routes smugglers use to traffic drugs in the country. The easy availability of the drugs in these areas increases the drug usage exponentially. By understanding the routes, border security forces can significantly reduce the transport of drugs from Pakistan and other neighbouring countries to India.\n\nDrug problem in Punjab and its connection to Khalistani Movement\n\nN.S. Jamwal in \u2018Management of land borders\u2019 mentioned that during the peak of the Khalistan movement in Punjab, Sikh terrorists in Punjab made an \u201cunholy alliance\u201d with the drug traffickers. They used to get weapons from Pakistan with the help of drug traffickers. The traffickers arrested by the security forces confessed on many instances that the security forces on the other side allowed them to cross the border on the condition that they will deliver weapons to the terrorist organizations in India. Even after terrorism in Punjab was nabbed by the security forces, the use of drug traffickers to deliver weapons and funds to terror organizations is still in use.\n\nDr. Pushpita Das, Associate Fellow at the IDSA, in a report on Drug Trafficking in India, said that during the 1980s, the Lahore-Fazilka-Bhatinda-Delhi route became the most favoured route to send drugs in India, followed by the Attari-Wagah route. It has been alleged that the Samjhauta Express has been frequently used to transport illicit drugs from across the border.\n\nThough the connection between Khalistan and drug trafficking via Pakistan can be traced back to more than four decades, there has been an increase in such cases in recent times. Here are some notable cases that help in exploring the connection between Pakistan\u2019s ISI and Khalistan Movement.\n\n532 KG heroin was seized on Attari Border, Amritsar in June 2019. It was being brought via trade route hidden in hundreds of rock salt bags. The main accused, Ranjeet Singh Rana, was arrested in May 2020 in Haryana. His location was revealed during interrogation Bikram Singh and Maninder Singh, who were accomplices of Hilal Ahmed Wagay, a close associate of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo. When Bikram was arrested, he was en route to deliver 29 lakh of drug money to Wagay.\n\nIn July 2019, there were reports that Pakistan based Khalistani terrorists are smuggling drugs in India to fuel terror-activities in Punjab. The report mentioned three instances linked to Paramjit Singh Panjwar, chief of Khalistan Commando Force, a terrorist organisation, based in Lahore since 1994. In May 2019, six Pakistani fishermen were arrested for smuggling 218 KG narcotics on Gujarat border. On 26th May the Maldivian police intercepted an Iranian boat with a Pakistani national and seized large quantity of drugs that were supposed to be delivered in India. On 10th July, based on Indian Intelligence\u2019s inputs, Sri Lankan coast guard seized 50 KG heroin from a Pakistani boat.\n\nAccording to a report of February 2020, the Khalistan Liberation Force leader Harmeet Singh \u201cPHD\u201d was killed in Pakistan over a rivalry between two groups as they wanted to have control over drug money. Singh was wanted in 17 cases by Indian security forces. The Hindu quoted an anonymous source who stated the recent increase in drug trafficking has resulted in the generation of huge money for the syndicates that they are using to push weapons for terror activities in India.\n\nIn July 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) designated nine individuals associated with Khalistani Movement as terrorists. Out of those ten individuals, Lakhbir Singh Rode and Paramjit Singh Panjwar were designated as terrorists for their involvement in drug trafficking and anti-India activities.\n\nIs Khalistan Movement rising again in Punjab?\n\nThough Punjab has not experienced surge in terror activities in the recent years, there is no doubt that from time to time Khalistani Movement shows its presence in the state. Since \u201cReferendum 2020\u201d was launched by Khalistani supporters that is supposed to happen in November 2020, there has been an increase in Khalistan-related activities in Punjab. In June 2020, on the 36th anniversary of operation Blue Star, Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said every Sikh wants Khalistan. Ahead on Independence day 2020, journalists across states received malicious calls demanding the creation of Urdustan and Khalistan. On 15th August, pro-Khalistani elements were arrested for hoisting Khalistani flags on government buildings. On 23rd August, a Khalistani sympathizer was arrested for praying in support of the Referendum 2020.\n\nThese activities need the money and the nexus between Khalistani groups, ISI and smugglers are raising easy drug money to support militancy in Punjab while destroying the youth with drug addiction.",

Actress Kalki Koechlin, who was married to Kashyap from 2011 to 2015, and Aarti Bajaj, Kashyap\u2019s wife from 2003 to 2009, had put out social media posts in support of Anurag Kashyap.\n\nIn her post, Kalki Koechlin had written, \u201cDear Anurag, Don\u2019t let this social media circus get to you. You have fought for the freedom of women in your own scripts, you\u2019ve defended their integrity in your professional space as well as your personal life.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Anurag Kashyap\u2019s first wife and editor Aarti Bajaj also shared a similar note on Instagram, calling the director a \u2018rockstar\u2019. \u201cFirst wife here\u2026 You are a rockstar, Anurag Kashyap. Keep empowering women as you do and the safest place you create for all of them.

He said it was okay and all the actresses who worked with him such as Huma Qureshi, Richa Chadha, Mahi Gill, they are just a call away.\u201d\n\nApparently, Anurag Kashyap told her, \u201cWhenever I call them, they come running and suck my c**k (penis)\u201d.\n\nThe director had also told her that such physical relationships are normal. \u201cThe next day he called me again. He said he wanted to discuss something with me. I went to his place, he was drinking whiskey or scotch, whatever I don\u2019t know. It was smelling very bad.

    "text": "Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata commonly known as JRD Tata needs no introduction. Known as the father of aviation, JRD Tata founded India\u2019s first international airline- Air India and went on to become the longest-serving chairman of the Tata group.\n\nIn the 90s, the business magnet was interviewed by journalist Rajiv Mehrotra as part of his \u201cIn Conversation\u201d series, which aired on Doordarshan. According to the website of Tata, the interview was taken in the spring of 1987, and it is the only known television interview of the legend. In the interview, JRD spoke on diverse issues, ranging from his professional life to India\u2019s political influence, policies and governance. However, he particularly spoke in length about the lack of economic development under the leadership of India first PM Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress legacy which followed.\n\nJRD Tata\u2019s modesty\n\nIn the interview, a part of which has now gone viral on social media, the man under whose chairmanship the assets of the Tata Group grew from US$101 million to over US$5 billion, modestly said that except for Air India, he did not create anything from scratch or anything entirely new. \u201cIt so happened that I inherited the situation\u201d, said JRD. He said that it was already being led by a good team of people when he got into Tata\u2019s after the demise of his father Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata in 1926, and that his job was to motivate them and \u201ckeep things going and going\u201d.\n\nTo make light of his achievements at a young age, the philanthropist joked that he was appointed the chairman of the Tata group \u201cprematurely\u201d at the age of 34 and that his appointment was \u2018a moment of mental aberration\u2019.\n\nHow Morarji Desai unceremoniously terminated JRD Tata from Air India\u2019s chairmanship\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDuring the course of the conversation, JRD\u2019s passion for Air India was evident as he said that Air India was the \u201conly one thing which I may feel that I was wholly responsible for\u201d.\n\nJRD Tata opened up on how he continued as chairman of Air-India till 1978, until he was unceremoniously terminated from his services in February by the then Prime Minister Morarji Desai. \u201cHe didn\u2019t inform me for 8 to 10 days, until I received a letter thanking me for my services\u201d, he informed.\n\nJRD recollected that his termination was \u201cnot unexpected\u201d considering his \u201clove-hate relationship with the then PM of India\u201d. He said that though they were friends \u201cthe man was quite impossible to deal with\u201d. Distressed by the disastrous act of vindictiveness, JRD says that \u201cthe way it was done was not pleasent\u201d.\n\nFor the uninitiated, In 1978, Prime Minister Morarji Desai-led government unceremoniously dropped JRD from the chairmanship of Air India and the directorship of Indian Airlines. A year earlier, he had already been removed from the board of the Atomic Energy Commission on which he had served since its inception in 1948. JRD, who was in Jamshedpur then learnt about his termination through a radio announcement.\n\nOn his return to Bombay House on 9 February, JRD found a letter from the prime minister dated 4 February and dispatched from Delhi on 6 February. The press reports on 11 February finally clarified that he had been removed from the position with retrospective effect from 1 February.\n\nIn his reply, a terribly upset JRD who had served Air India for a quarter-century without remuneration of a single rupee stated: \u201cI hope you will not consider it presumptuous of me to have expected that when the government decided to terminate my services and my forty-five years\u2019 association with Indian civil aviation, I would be informed of their decision directly, and if possible, in advance of the public\u2026\u201d\n\nThe airline crew and public on a whole were extremely outraged at this sudden development as Air India was, at that time, a matter of deep national pride, and JRD was synonymous with Air India\u2019s success and service. Morarji Desai\u2019s decision had brought him some of the worst publicity since he took office as prime minister.\n\nStupid enough to think at one stage to join the Congress party: JRD Tata\n\nWhen asked whether he ever felt the urge to participate in India\u2019s freedom struggle, JRD says: \u201cI was stupid enough to think at one stage to give up the idea of becoming a businessman or an Industrial leader and join the Congress party\u201d. He continued saying that he was highly impressed by Jawaharlal Nehru, but then he realised that all that would mean getting arrested and going to jail, where he couldn\u2019t have done anything significant.\n\nInterestingly, one of the main reasons why Veer Savarkar had also written a mercy petition to the British was that he too thought what bravery it is to be in jail if one can serve in other ways being out of it. The Congress, especially the party\u2019s senior leader Rahul Gandhi probably needs to understand this before taking cheap digs at the freedom fighter.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru made grave mistakes in policy decissions\n\nCalling himself apolitical, JRD opined that he found himself opposed to the Congress government\u2019s policies. Though he was an admirer and a friend to Jay Prakash Narayan and Jawaharlal Nehru, both of them, particularly Jawaharlal Nehru made grave mistakes in handling the political processes of India, said JRD.\n\n\u201cNehru\u2019s socialism is what I consider to be the wrong type of socialism, bureaucratism etc\u201d. JRD said that he had never done any lobbying, rather he had been very vocal rather a critic, of the government policies which should have been implemented but were not by the then Congress government.\n\nHe continued that how for instance he was averse to the blind nationalisation of industries, which he thought would mean bureaucracy and lethargy. He said that there were many considerations which made him opposed to nationalisation.\n\nBritish parliamentary system was not fit for India\n\nThe former chairman of the Tata conglomerate opined that the system of democratic governance which Congress adopted from the British was not fit for India. He said: \u201cI was more and more concerned with the adoption of the British parliamentary system in India. I was convinced that it would not work in India\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have often thought that if fate had decreed that Vallabhbhai Patel instead of Jawaharlal, would be the younger of the two, India would have followed a very different path and would be in better economic shape than it is today\u201d, said JRD opining that Jawaharlal Nehru knew very little about economics and socialism and he was simply not even open to ideas. \u201cSocialism could be established without the loss of the economic freedom of the majority of the people, but Jawahar was not even interested in listening\u201d.\n\nHere, JRD paused for a second to say that he needs to be very careful of what he says, probably hinting at the atmosphere of fear and intimidation for industrialists and bureaucrats when Congress government was at the helm of affairs in the country.\n\n\u201cWhen it came to issues like economics, nationalisation, bureaucracy, he (Jawaharlal Nehru) was not only disinterested he was unwilling to talk, and he developed a trick to avoid the conversation. JRD said that whenever he tried to initiate a conversation with the former PM on these issues he would look out of the window\u2026 and \u201cI would get the hint that he is not interested\u201d, recollected JRD.\n\nIndira Gandhi was as disinterested as her father\n\nJRD Tata disclosed that Indira Gandhi was similar, she too would not listen to things against socialism, but, however, her trick to avoid the conversation was slightly different from that of her father. Essentially when someone disagreed or argued against what she was doing, she would start picking up envelopes from the table and pulling out letters, \u201cPractically hinting that look\u2026I have other things to do\u201d.\n\nBasically, what JRD implied that both the father-daughter duo were never interested in the economic development of the country. One needs to pause and think here that if Nehru and Indira could brush-off someone as influential as JRD Tata, how would they have been dealing with dissent otherwise.\n\nJRD Tata predicted political instability in the past\n\nAsked about his political views, as the year when the interview happened was the election year, JRD continued that if Rajiv Gandhi and the Congress party is ousted by the Opposition then the same thing would happen what happened during the short tenure of Janata Party government. Basically the visionary had then warned that Congress\u2019 loss would lead to political instability which is exactly what happened with smaller parties heading the government for short terms after the fall of Rajiv Gandhi govt. Whether it was led by V P Singh or Charan Singh or Chandrashekhar, all have been failures.\n\nSaying so he said that whoever be at the helm of affairs as a citizen of the country he wants that the government works on issues like agriculture, employment, industrialisation and population control\u2026\u201dthings on which very little is being done now\u201d, said JRD.\n\nLicence Raj- the bureaucratic muddle for \u2018make in India\u2019.\n\nAsked about his opinion on industrial development and modernisation which is a key to economic growth, JRD said that only modern equipment can make manufacturing cheaper and attractive, but labour unions are averse to modernisation and the problem is that labor unions are backed by politicians.\n\nHe goes on to speak of how industrialisation was scuttled during those days because of the Licence-permit Raaj. He said that companies need permission for everything, \u201chad this been a government hotel, even to move a chair in this room permission would have been required\u201d, exclaimed JRD. At that time companies could not expand capacity without permission, also new companies were not allowed in many sectors, so existing companies had no incentive to innovate. Basically what JRD Tata implied was that the Licence Raj was the bureaucratic hurdle for \u2018make in India\u2019.\n\nOn Black money\n\n\u201cWhen I joined business, there was no black money. There was no corruption, for whom were you to corrupt? When you did not have a system of government control where you had to get a permit for everything. In the early days, taxes were also very low. Black money will always be there as long as taxes and controls are high,\u201d said JRD.\n\nBased on his half a century of experience under different systems of government, the former Tata Group chairman affirmed that black money will always be there till taxes are high and the government controls are high.\n\nJehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, who was born on July 29, 1904, is the recipient of two of India\u2019s highest civilian awards \u2014 the Padma Vibhushan and the Bharat Ratna. JRD Tata is not only remembered as a great industrialist but also as a keen aviator.\n\nJRD Tata joined the family business as an apprentice and became the chairman of Tata & Sons at the age of 34. He also led the group to diversify and oversaw that Tata Group becomes one of the most trusted brands in India. It was under his leadership that Tata Group diversified into aviation after he formed an aviation department called Tata Airlines which later became Air India. In fact, JRD Tata is widely considered to be the Father of Indian Aviation for his pioneering role in civil aviation.\n\nThe full interview can be viewed here:",

    "text": "On the recent farm sector reform bills, the hypocrisies of the opposition are perhaps too numerous to count. We could start from the fact that in 2012, then Prime Minister Dr. Singh appealed to states to reform the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and create a national market. In his signature style of always using a raincoat when in the shower, Dr. Singh didn\u2019t actually do anything.\n\nThen, there is of course the fact that the Congress manifesto for the 2019 elections promised to end the monopoly of the APMCs. On the Essential Commodities Act of 1955, the Congress manifesto was even more severe, perhaps taking a jibe at Nehru! The Congress manifesto called it something that belongs to the \u201cage of controls.\u201d Very clear thinking, one must say. Except that the Congress is opposing both its manifesto promises right now.\n\nThen, there is Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram. He wants to know how the government will guarantee an MSP in private transactions. Well, the new act does not abolish APMCs, it merely removes their monopoly. When the higher MSP is still available at the APMC, why would any farmer sell at a lower price outside it?\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the Congress. There are the left parties as well, who have been vocal in their criticism. Ironically, CPI(M) ruled Kerala is one of the few states that does not even have APMCs. Nobody knows what the left is even doing.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBut as long as venerable members of the opposition can climb up to the table of the presiding officer of the Rajya Sabha and break his mike, who cares? Opposing Modi is the one point agenda. No matter how silly they look.\n\nBut the BJP government needs to watch out about what comes next. The so called \u201cage of controls\u201d may be over, but the mentality of that era might not be. The ghost of socialism is far from dead. We never know what can bring the paranoid socialist era fears back with a bang.\n\nAnd if the \u201cecosystem\u201d can do anything about it, they most certainly will.\n\nThe year was 1998 and Atalji had just assumed power as Prime Minister. This was India\u2019s first truly non-Congress government. As Modi ji had put it in 2013, Atal Behari Vajpayee was the first Prime Minister of India who did not come from what he called \u201cCongress gotra.\u201d\n\nThen, something happened, which a lot of people may not be old enough to remember. The prices of onions started soaring and nobody knew why. People had never seen a non-Congress government before. Sure, they were hopeful, but they were also nervous. Nobody knew for sure if a non-Congress government could actually run the country. And when the price of onions began soaring, panic set in among the populace.\n\nThe media quickly got into the act. The newspapers began raising a fever pitch. Entertainers such as comedians on TV stepped in as well to create a wave of public opinion against the new government. Remember that back then, almost all of these people were beholden to the old establishment.\n\nThe panic cost the BJP heavily in the state elections later that year. It lost Delhi and Rajasthan by massive margins. In Madhya Pradesh, Digvijay Singh managed to save his government by a whisker.\n\nThe onion panic of 1998 cost the BJP three crucial states. The elections ended. The price of onions came down to normal.\n\nCould something similar happen with food items today, after the reforms to the Essential Commodities Act? We don\u2019t know, but the fear certainly is there.\n\nTo be sure, things are a lot different now. The ecosystem is much weaker than it was in 1998. Those who run the links in the supply chain are no longer beholden to the old establishment. Not everyone in the media is beholden to them either. And finally, the population itself has changed. Nobody asks today if a non-Congress government can run the country.\n\nBut it never hurts to be forever watchful.",

    "text": "If you stand in the crowd at Mumbai\u2019s CST station, you are likely to come across at least one Bilkis. A common name for an Indian Muslim girl, \u201cBilkis\u201d could be almost anyone among the great masses. But today, among the 1300 million citizens of India, one Bilkis stands apart.\n\nIndian liberals are very proud of her. The 82 year old Bilkis has been featured as one of the most influential people in the world by TIME Magazine.\n\nAt 82 years of age, Bilkis must have seen a lot of life. This is not a biography of Bilkis. I do not know about her, except that she was part of the protests at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi. Like I said, Bilkis could be any face in the crowd. This is a telling of all the things that could have happened to someone named Bilkis as she grew up in India, all the way to the ripe old age of 82. All the crimes that could have been committed against her. All the crimes that would have been approved by Indian \u201cliberalism.\u201d\n\nWhat if \u2018Bilkis\u2019 was a 62 year old mother of five, who had dedicated her whole life to raising her children? And what if her husband had one day pronounced a talaq against her and turned her into the street, without a single paisa to her name? What if, at the age of 62 years, she found the strength to approach the Supreme Court and actually win the right to alimony? What would liberals do? Would they want to see her on the cover of TIME Magazine?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNo. Of course not. Indian liberals would want Parliament to call an emergency session and pass a law to deprive her of the means of living. The liberals would go on to proudly call this the \u201cMuslim Woman (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act.\u201d She would receive the \u201cprotection\u201d of losing everything. Like George Orwell said, \u201cFreedom is slavery.\u201d\n\nWhat if \u2018Bilkis\u2019 was a woman living an ordinary married life and one day her husband just decided to get rid of her? All he would have to do is say \u201cTalaq \u2013 Talaq \u2013 Talaq.\u201d Three times. That\u2019s all. If he was an even bigger coward and unable to look her in the eye, he could just say the words by SMS. And she would be out of his life instantly. She would have been cast away with no rights to anything. Indian liberals would have supported that.\n\nWhat if \u2018Bilkis\u2019 gave up her self respect and begged and pleaded on hearing those three words, or reading them in an SMS? What if her begging and pleading melted her now ex-husband\u2019s heart and he agreed to take her back? What would \u2018Bilkis\u2019 have to do? First, she would have to sleep with a strange man as part of \u201cNikah-Halala.\u201d Indian liberals would have supported that too.\n\nWhat if \u2018Bilkis\u2019 was 30 years old and suddenly heard the terrible news that her father had passed away? Her father would have worked hard his whole life to leave something for all his children, whom he would have loved equally. So can \u2018Bilkis\u2019 get an equal share of the inheritance?\n\nNot if \u2018Bilkis\u2019 had any brothers. As a daughter, she would be entitled to receive [pdf] only half of what her brothers get. Actually, that\u2019s wrong. As a daughter, she isn\u2019t \u201centitled\u201d to anything. Muslim personal law divides people into \u201csharers\u201d and \u201cresiduaries.\u201d The sons are \u201csharers\u201d : they are the ones who are entitled to a share of the property. As a \u2018daughter\u2019 she can only be a \u201cresiduary\u201d: those who take up what is left over after the sharers have taken their part!\n\nEqual citizen of India. But not equal in the eyes of the law. Indian liberals support this.\n\nWhat if \u2018Bilkis\u2019 was a mere teenager, perhaps 15 or 16 years old? At that age, she would most likely be starting to develop an interest in boys. Perhaps thinking about holding hands with a boy or dreaming about her first kiss. Not old enough for marriage. Or for that matter, dating anyone seriously. She would have too much homework at school anyway. Could they take young \u2018Bilkis\u2019 and force her to get married? They absolutely could. A Muslim girl in India can be legally married off once she has hit puberty. Liberals support this as well.\n\nWhat if \u2018Bilkis\u2019 was a naturally curious 10 year old girl, with an interest in math or science? Would her teachers at school spot her talent and try to nurture it? Well, not necessarily. Her \u201cschool\u201d could be a madrassa that does not even teach science or math. It would still be called a \u201cschool\u201d despite the fact that it doesn\u2019t teach math or science. In 2015, the Govt of Maharashtra decided that in order to be recognized as a school, it must teach math and science. Liberals were very angry with this. They said this was an example of \u201cintolerance.\u201d When has anything good ever come from teaching math and science to kids?\n\nWhat if \u2018Bilkis\u2019 was a six or seven year old girl and they decided to mutilate her genitals? Should that be legal? Indian liberals seem to think it should be. As for the Supreme Court, they have referred the matter to a larger bench. They are still thinking. We will know when the honorable justices have made up their minds.\n\nAnd finally, let us get back to a protest site such as Shaheen Bagh. What if \u2018Bilkis\u2019 was an infant, a newborn barely a few days old? What if her mother and father kept taking her out to the protest in the bitterly cold Delhi winter nights? What if \u2018Bilkis\u2019 was coughing, but she was so little that nobody even noticed? What if one day, her struggles suddenly came to an end, without so much as making a sound? And she left the cruel world, just a few weeks old? All this while, secular intellectuals would be circling like vultures, making provocative speeches and glorifying the mothers for bringing babies out there. And of course, scouting for a kind looking 82 year old grandmother to put on the cover of TIME Magazine\u2026\n\nLike I said before, \u2018Bilkis\u2019 could be any face in the crowd. In India, \u2018Bilkis\u2019 could come in many forms. But Indian liberals love just one of them.",

    "text": "Ironically, the Congress Party, which dances to the tune of the uchch koti (upper-tier), Janeudhari, Kaul-Dattatreya gotra Brahmin\u2013 Rahul Gandhi, has time and again expressed its adherence to the anti-Hindu E V Ramasamy, popularly known as EVR and hailed as \u2018Periyar\u2019 by his followers. Today, once again the disciples of this \u2018janeudhari Brahmin\u2018 have taken to the microblogging site Twitter to pay homage to the demagogue, who used the social evils which were then prevalent or perceived, as a capital for his propaganda.\n\nThe Congress party hailed Periyar as one of the strongest proponents against caste and gender inequality and discrimination in a tweet posted on its official Twitter handle. They further refered to him as a beacon of rationalism and self-respect.\n\nFounder of Self-Respect Movement & the Father of the Dravidian Movement, #Periyar was one of the strongest proponents against caste & gender inequality & discrimination. A beacon of rationalism & self-respect, he inspires countless struggles against marginalisation even today. pic.twitter.com/THmiifTJkJ \u2014 Congress (@INCIndia) September 17, 2020\n\nThe Janeudhari Brahmin-Rahul Gandhi\u2019s fondness for the anti-Brahmin Periyar\n\nThe Congress party\u2019s tweet does not come as a surprise because the janeudhari (sacred thread-wearing) Brahmin Rahul Gandhi has himself in the past, heaped praises and glorified Periyar, who is widely recognised as a rabid anti-Hindu, anti-Brahmin \u2018intellectual\u2019.\n\nPeriyar hated the Hindus and the Brahmins\n\nContrary to the Congress Party\u2019s beliefs, the Dravidanist icon was neither a rationalist nor a humanist. In fact, he was a vehement advocate of anti-Hinduism, anti-Brahminism and a pro-British.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMany EVR apologists today indulge in the propaganda that EVR never advocated racial hatred against Brahmins. However, EVR was explicit in his agenda. The magazine Periyar edited published articles praising the ascendancy of Adolf Hitler and warned Brahmins in Tamil Nadu that they should learn from the plight of Jews in Nazi Germany and opt for course correction.\n\nPeriyar\u2019s dislike for Brahmins was so deep-rooted in him that he was almost blinded by his intense hatred and anger directed at Brahmins. He reportedly used to tell his followers that if they ever encountered a Brahmin and a snake on the road, they should kill the Brahmin first.\n\nPeriyar hated Hindu Gods and Godesses\n\nMoreover, Periyar was a staunch critic of Hindu Gods and Goddesses. He has, in his lifetime, spread numerous canards about the Ramayana. All his lies were directed towards slandering the God who is considered Maryada Purshottam by Hindus. His lies ranged from accusing Shri Rama of being casteist to claiming that he killed and mutilated women.\n\nPeriyar not only claimed that no \u2018North Indian Brahmin\u2019 died in the war against Ravana but further propagated that Lord Rama had married women other than Sita for his sexual pleasure. He had also claimed that Lankan King Ravana was, in fact, a Dravidian King from South India. Periyar had also burnt pictures of Lord Rama, who is one of the most revered Hindu gods. This is not all, Periyar is notorious for organizing a procession in Salem in Tamil Nadu with big cutouts of \u201cRam\u201d, \u201cSita\u201d and \u201cHanuman\u201d garlanded with slippers.\n\nApart from his hatred for Lord Rama, Periyar also broke statues of Lord Ganesha.\n\nIn fact, all his deeds reflected the virtual hatred that he harboured towards Hindus and Brahmins.\n\nPeriyar was a pro-British\n\nApart from being profoundly anti-Hindu, it is a well-known fact that EVR and his movement were pro-British and they also supported the Muslim League in its pro-Pakistan demand. In an interview to a Tamil magazine, Anantha Vikatan, in 1965, EVR expressed how he had hoped that, given the pro-British stand of their movement, the British would hand over the authority to the Justice party.\n\nPeriyar seldom practiced what he advocated\n\nFor the uninitiated, after quitting the Congress Party, Periyar served as the President of Justice Party (1938 \u2013 1944) in erstwhile Madras state. The party formed provincial governments in Madras state between 1920 and 1937 and it was one of the first to come up with caste-based reservations. Due to the success of Congress and internal rifts, the party declined after 1937. Periyar formed the Dravida Kazhagam in 1944.\n\nBut Periyar\u2019s second marriage to a much younger woman and her anointment as his heir in politics sparked off a rift between Periyar and his protege CN Annadurai. Periyar seldom practised what he preached. The Dravidanist icon, who had strongly advocated women liberation and rights, had to the astonishment of his followers gone on to marry a woman who was 4 decades younger to him. A 70-year old Periyar Ramasami had married a 30-year old woman, Maniamma. Protesting against the unethical behaviour of Periyar, Annadurai and his supporters left the Dravidar Kazhagam en-masse and they founded a new political outfit in 1949 called the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).\n\nIndia\u2019s former Prime Minister and Congress leader Indira Gandhi did not approve of Periyar ideologies. She had after Periyar\u2019s death, rebuffed the demands of his supporters to abandon Ram Leela. Following his death, Periyarists also attempted to make \u2018Ravana Leela\u2019 an annual event, to coincide with Dussehra celebrations in the rest of the country, however, the PM Indira Gandhi had not given the approval for the same, urging them to avoid arousing sectarian sentiments.\n\nNot only Indira Gandhi, in fact, Jawaharlal Nehru had also once said: \u201cOld and SENILE men like Periyar deserve a place more in a lunatic asylum than in public life. It is HIGH time Periyar and his followers were BANISHED from this land.\u201d\n\nContrary to the views of the past leaders of the grand old party, Rahul Gandhi has gone on to openly express his support for the rabid anti-Hindu Periyar. This only goes on to reflect how shallow the Congress party under Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi have become, that for their petty politics, they actively support everyone who speaks ill of Hindu Gods and Goddesses and hurts the sentiments of Hindus.",

    "text": "Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey needs no introduction for he has been making headlines of late for his statements and a strict way of working. It was being speculated for some time that he has tendered resignation. It is now clear that he has taken voluntary retirement from service amidst the speculations of joining politics. His request for voluntary retirement was approved by the Bihar government yesterday. Pandey will be live on his social media account on Twitter today to talk about his voluntary retirement. It is noteworthy that Bihar is set to conduct assembly polls in 2 months and the former cop was to retire after 5 months.\n\nRecently, a picture of his with District President of the Janta Dal (United) had gone viral which had led to the speculations that he might be contesting elections. Pandey who is a 1987 batch IPS officer had earlier served as zonal IG at Muzaffarpur. He served at various posts including SP, Range DIG, ADG Headquarter and DG BMC.\n\nThe rules require a three month cooling off period before taking voluntary retirement but this condition was relaxed by the Bihar government considering the seniority of Pandey. He was appointed as the DGP of Bihar in 2019 after the retirement of then DGP KS Dwivedi. Pandey had also requested for voluntary retirement in 2009 when he was serving as the IG amid the speculations of joining politics. But later, he had withdrawn his request.\n\nSK Singhal, who is currently serving as DG Home guard, will now succeed Pandey as the Bihar DGP. SK Singhal was posted at the Headquarters for a long time before being promoted as the DGP. Besides, three other IPS officers have been shuffled in Bihar. Singhal is counted among some of the most vigilant police officers in the police department.\n\nGupteshwar Pandey\u2019s early life and background\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAfter completing his education from Patna University, Gupteshwar Pandey was selected for the IRS but he was not satisfied with it and therefore he again appeared for the UPSC examination and got selected for the IPS. His services in the police department span over 31 years. His experience in state of Bihar can be estimated by the fact that he has served in 26 districts of the state in different capacities.\n\nHe has earlier said that if people felt that he should become a politician then he would definitely join politics. In, 1961, when Pandey was born, his village Gerua in the Buxar district was not connected via road and had no basic facilities like Hospital, electricity and education. Pandey tells that he used to go to school wearing briefs and vest and could not even speak proper Hindi till 12th standard. He only knew Bhojpuri.\n\nPandey has two brothers one of whom is a farmer and the other works in media. Interestingly, his graduation subject was Sanskrit. He started the preparation for the UPSC because session for MA was delayed. Pandey admits that no one in his family ever went to school before him. At most, some family members could manage to sign their names. His father, who was a Sadhu, had no idea about what and where Pandey was studying.\n\nIn an interview given to Lallantop, Pandey told that he was motivated to prepare for the UPSC after he saw an average student become an IAS officer. When he was posted in Begusarai, there used to be stronghold of a mafia named Ashok Samrat who used to virtually run an unofficial government there. He owned a number of factories there which enabled him to exercise his power. Pandey started putting those people behind the bars who had dozens of cases filed against them.\n\nDeepak Thakur\u2019s song \u2018Robinhood Bihar k\u201d (Video Credit: DT Production)\n\nHe made headlines after putting over 400 criminals behind the bars in around 42 encounters. Pandey, who chose Sanskrit as his optional subject in the UPSC examination, has special concerns for Bihar and he has been raising voice for the development of the state. He played an active role in getting the investigation of Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s mysterious death referred to the CBI.\n\nHe has special interest in music and singing. Few months ago, an album was released in which he had sung a song. Recently, he was seen in the video of a song which was based on him. It is to be seen whether Pandey will be able to leave an equally strong impression in politics as he left in the police department. Considering his proximity with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, it is being speculated that he might join the JDU.",

    "text": "One of the biggest factors plaguing the growth of agriculture sector in the country is the inability of the farmer to find a market and to get a fair price to his produce. To address the issue, the erstwhile governments of different states enacted the Agricultural Produce Market Regulation Acts (APMC Acts), which authorised them to set up and regulate marketing practices in wholesale markets.\n\nThe objective of these markets was to ensure that farmers get a fair price for their produce. However, with each passing year, the APMCs turned out to be inefficient with increasing cartelisation of middlemen, ban on private players to enter the trade, increasing corruption etc.\n\nRealising the inadequacies in the existing APMC acts of various states to offer a proper marketing mechanism for the farmers to sell their produce, the Narendra Modi government in 2014 had announced a unified National Agriculture Market (NAM). NAM is a pan-India electronic trading portal which seeks to connect existing APMCs and other market yards to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities.\n\nContinuing the reform agenda, the Modi government has now introduced three more bills to promote much easier trade for the farm produce and to provide a competitive market for the producers outside the existing APMC system.\n\nThree bills introduced by the Modi government\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe three bills introduced by the Modi government in the current session of Parliament are: The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020.\n\nEarlier, these reforms were announced as part of the third tranche of the economic package announced under Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan.\n\nThe new bills, when passed by the Parliament will give effect to the amendments proposed to the Essential Commodities Act and bring in two new central laws on trading and marketing of farm produce in the country.\n\nThe objective of the three proposed laws is to make way for creating the Modi government\u2019s ambitious vision of \u2018One India, One Agriculture Market\u2019. The law intends to end the monopoly of Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) in carrying out the trade of farm produce in the country.\n\nThe Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020:\n\nThe Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 aims at creating additional trading opportunities outside the APMC market yards to help farmers get remunerative prices due to additional competition. Farmers can now sell their agricultural produce in a market of their choice at better prices.\n\nThe newly proposed law will allow intra-state and inter-state trade of farmers\u2019 produce beyond the physical premises of APMC markets thus giving freedom for the farmers and traders to sell or purchase farm products anywhere.\n\nThe proposed law also provides buyers with the freedom to buy farmers\u2019 produce outside the APMC markets without having any license or paying any fees to APMCs.\n\nThe Bill prohibits state governments from levying any market fee, cess or levy on farmers, traders for the trade conducted on farmers\u2019 produce conducted in an \u2018outside trade area\u2019.\n\nUnder the proposed law, electronic trading in transaction platform has been proposed for ensuring a seamless trade electronically. The proposed law also allows private individuals, FPOs and co-ops to set up electronic trading platforms in these areas.\n\nThere will also be a separate dispute resolution mechanism for the farmers.\n\nThe Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020:\n\nThe Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 creates a framework for contract farming through an agreement between a farmer and a buyer prior to the production or rearing of any farm produce.\n\nThe proposed law provides for a farming agreement between a farmer and a buyer prior to the production or rearing of any farm produce. The minimum period of an agreement will be one crop season or one production cycle of livestock.\n\nUnder this legislation, farmers are empowered to directly engage with processors, wholesalers, aggregators, retailers exporters etc, thus eliminating intermediaries resulting in full realisation of the price for the farm produce.\n\neliminating intermediaries resulting in full realisation of the price for the farm produce. The proposed law also states that the price of farming produce negotiated between the trader and the farmer should be mentioned in the agreement.\n\nThe buyer will be responsible for providing necessary means or inputs for good crop yield. Under the bill, it is the responsibility of the buyer to provide agricultural equipment to the farmer.\n\nIt provides for a three-level dispute settlement mechanism: the conciliation board, Sub-Divisional Magistrate and Appellate Authority.\n\nThe Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020:\n\nThe amendments to the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 allows the central government to regulate the supply of certain food items only under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nUnder the legislation, the central government may regulate or prohibit the production, supply, distribution, trade, and commerce of such essential commodities.\n\nThe proposed bill provides for the central government to regulate the supply of certain food items including cereals, pulses, potatoes, onions, edible oilseeds, and oils, only under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe legislation requires that imposition of any stock limit on agricultural produce must be based on price rise.\n\nThe bill amends the Essential Commodities Act to provide that stock limits for agricultural products can be imposed only when retail prices increase sharply and exempts value chain participants and exporters from any stock limit.\n\nSignificance of the proposed laws:\n\nThe three historic legislation will unlock the overly regulated agricultural markets in the country.\n\nThe laws will provide more choices for the farmer and lessen the marketing costs for the farmers thus helping them to get better prices. It will also help farmers of regions with surplus produce to get better prices and consumers of regions with shortages, lower prices.\n\nThe laws will enable the farmer to make use of modern technology and better inputs to enhance their farm produce and its trade. It will reduce the cost of marketing and improve the income of farmers.\n\nmake use of modern technology and better inputs to enhance their farm produce and its trade. It will reduce the cost of marketing and improve the income of farmers. These new laws will encourage large companies, food processing firms, exporters, etc, to invest in the farm sector and source good-quality farm produce.\n\nThe announced amendment to the Essential Commodities Act is expected to help both farmers and consumers while bringing in price stability.\n\nThe proposed changes will also create a competitive market environment and prevents wastage of agri-produce that happens due to lack of storage facilities.\n\nMany opposition parties, including the Congress, are opposing the bills. The Congress party, however, were once the proponents of the same reforms that are currently being introduced by the Modi government. Interestingly, in 2019, the Congress party under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi had themselves announced these reforms in their election manifesto.",

If the market price becomes more than the contact price, farmers will be entitled to the market price.\n\nThis will also enable farmers to access modern technology, high quality seed and other inputs like fertilisers and pesticides. The provisions of the bill will reduce the cost of marketing, and enhance the income of the farmers, as the buyer will have to directly pick up the produce from the farms. This will enable private investment in farming sector, and will link the farms with global markets.\n\nThe bill also has provisions for effective dispute resolution mechanism, so the farmers will not have to courts for any dispute. Moreover, 10000 Farmer Producer organizations are being formed throughout the country.

The bill also removes imprisonment for various offences which are considered procedural and technical in nature. For example, it removes the imprisonment of three years applicable to a company for buying back its shares without complying with the Act.\n\nThe bill further reduced the fine amount applicable for certain offences.

Bilateral netting refers to offsetting claims arising from dealings between two parties to determine the net amount payable or receivable from one party to the other.\n\nUnder the bill, a qualified financial contract (QFC) is a bilateral contract notified as a QFC by a relevant authority such as the Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority or International Financial Services Centres Authority. These authorities may designate entities, such as NBFCs or insurance or pension firms functioning under its jurisdiction, as qualified financial market participants to deal in QFCs.\n\nThe bill provides the enforcement of netting of QFCs if the contract has a netting agreement.

The bill also bars public servants from receiving foreign fund. The bill further says that organisations will be able to receive foreign funding only at a designated FCRA bank account in the State Bank of India in Delhi.

The concerned SBI branch in Delhi will report to the Home Minister about the source of funds, manner of reception, and the permitted limit of foreign remittance.\n\nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill\n\nThe bill amends the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 which provides a time bound process for resolving insolvency in companies and also among individuals. It replaces the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 promulgated in June this year in an effort to give relief to companies facing the heat due to Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Bill seeks to temporarily suspend initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) under the Code. When a default occurs, the Code allows the creditors of the company or the company itself to initiate CIRP by filing an application before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The Bill provides that for defaults arising during the six months from March 25, 2020, CIRP cannot be initiated by either the company or its creditors.\n\nThis amendment was brought due to the Covid-19 situation to give the immunity to the business from insolvency proceedings in this critical situation.\n\nThe Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Bill\n\nThe bill amends the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 to include protections for health care service personnel combating epidemic diseases and expands the powers of the Central Government to prevent the spread of such diseases.

Factoring business is a business where an entity (referred as factor) acquires the receivables of another entity (referred as assignor) for an amount. Factor can be a bank, a registered non-banking financial company or any company registered under the Companies Act.\n\nThe Bill amends the definition of the assignment to add that a transfer can be in whole or in part. It also amends the definition of factoring as acquisition of receivables of an assignor by assignment for a consideration.\n\nThe amendments are expected to help micro, small and medium enterprises significantly by providing added avenues for getting credit facility, especially through Trade Receivables Discounting System. This will lead to increase in the availability of working capital of such enterprises.\n\n22 September 2020\n\nThe Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill\n\nThe Bill replaces the Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 which was promulgated on April 24, 2020. It seeks to further extend the time to form the Central Council of Homeopathy by a year, after two years allowed for the purpose was over.\n\nThe Homoeopathy Central Council Act, 1973 was amended in 2018 to provide for the supersession of the Central Council of Homoeopathy.

He pointed out that around 74 per cent people in the Union Territory spoke Kashmiri and Dogri languages. According to 2011 census, only 0.16 per cent population in Jammu and Kashmir spoke Urdu, while 2.3 per cent spoke Hindi.\n\nThe Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code\n\nThis code consolidates 13 existing Acts regulating health, safety, and working conditions.

    "text": "NDTV \u2018journalist\u2019 Sreenivasan Jain took to Twitter on Tuesday to express his anger over the \u2018alleged\u2019 inaction of the Union government against Sudarshan News. The journalist, known for downplaying a terrorist attack as \u2018chota-mota\u2019, accused the Centre of safeguarding its \u2018own people\u2019 at all costs.\n\nSreenivasan Jain was incensed after Sudarshan News cited the NDTV show on \u2018Hindu terror\u2019 in the Supreme Court. While attacking the Centre, the NDTV journalist tweeted that it was \u2018worth-noting\u2019 the supposed extent to which the Union government had gone to defend Sudarshan TV.\n\nHe wrote, \u201cFrom the Solicitor General discovering press freedoms, to bogus whatabouttery (what about shows on Hindu terror?) to insisting that the Court first regulate digital media.\u201d\n\nThe extent to which the Centre has gone to stall action against Sudarshan TV is worth noting. From the Sol. Gen. discovering press freedoms, to bogus whatabouttery (\u2018what about shows on Hindu Terror?\u2019), to insisting that the Court first regulate digital media. 1/n \u2014 Sreenivasan Jain (@SreenivasanJain) September 22, 2020\n\nJain further alleged that it was a common practice for political parties to shield its people in the media. He added that the government occasionally sacrifices its own for the sake of neutrality and rule of law, provided the crime is \u2018egregiously bad.\u2019\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSreenivasan Jain tweeted, \u201cAll parties/govt\u2019s go out of their way to protect \u2018apne log\u2019 \u2013 our people. But occasionally, to maintain the veneer of neutrality and adherence to rule of law, you allow the action, especially if the stakes are low, and the \u2018crime\u2019 is egregiously bad.\u201d\n\nAll parties/govt\u2019s go out of their way to protect \u2018apne log\u2019 \u2013 our people.

He alleged that the government of the day would leave no stone unturned to defend its \u2018own people\u2019, even if would \u2018ruin\u2019 the rule of law.\n\n.. like the Sudarshan show, or Kapil Mishra, or the ABVP attackers of JNU. But this regime has again and again its determination to fight to the last to defend \u2018our people\u2019, regardless of the ruinous impact on the rule of law. 3/n \u2014 Sreenivasan Jain (@SreenivasanJain) September 22, 2020\n\nHe named three people, namely, Kapil Mishra, Sudarshan TV, and ABVP workers who allegedly attacked JNU, in the list of those whose crimes were \u2018egregiously\u2019 bad according to him. Jain continued with his unsolicited rant, \u201cBut this regime has, again and again, its determination to fight to the last to defend \u2018our people\u2019, regardless of the ruinous impact on the rule of law.\u201d\n\nSreenivasan Jain trivialises terror attack to peddle his agenda\n\nDuring one of his shows on NDTV, Sreenivasan Jain tried to downplay a terrorist attack to peddle his anti-Modi narrative. He had claimed that terrorists such as Ishrat Jahan, gunned down by the Gujarat Police during an ecounter, did not come to kill the then Gujarat Chief Minister but to do a \u2018chota-mota\u2018 (small-time) bomb blast.\n\nUnder the garb of informing the viewers about the CBI investigation into the encounter, the NDTV journalist had insuinated that since Ishran Jahan had come to only execute a small-time terror attack, therefore, she ought to have been treated well by the Gujarat police. Conveying that the terrorist deserved a \u2018fair trial\u2019, he tried to paint terrorism as a \u2018no-big deal\u2019 issue. It is therefore, surprising that a journalist who was once at the forefront of providing intellectual cover fire to a slain terrorist is today incensed about the government\u2019s alleged defence of a news channel, with views and opinions contrary to his.\n\nNDTV journalist slammed by investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala\n\nIn a recent interview with investor and businessman Rakesh Jhunjhunwala on NDTV, \u2018journalist\u2019 Sreenivasan Jain got a lesson in ethical media reporting. \u201cI am a fan of Mr. Modi \u2013 This is a well-known fact. As an Indian, I have a right to my political choices\u2026 But, I find you prejudiced. I find NDTV prejudiced against the government,\u201d Rakesh Jhunjhunwala emphasised. The NDTV journalist then made one last desperate attempt to dismiss the allegations against him and his media channel.\n\nSreenivasan Jain said, \u201cYou feel that your opinion is not prejudiced.\u201d Lambasting the motivated journalism of NDTV and Jain, the businessman reiterated, \u201cWell, I am a political animal. The press is not a political animal. You are supposed to be unprejudiced.\u201d Without nothing left to say, the journalist laughed aloud and claimed, \u201cI would love to think that I am unprejudiced.\u201d",

They escorted hundreds of pilgrims present in the premises to the safety, and many local individuals came forward to help provide support to transport injured to the hospitals.\n\nTargets shifted\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhen terrorists realized they could not open the main temple doors, they got into the Exhibition Hall 1 where a multimedia show was being played. They fired shots at the audience resulting in death and injuries to men, women, and children present in the hall. After leaving the Exhibition Hall, they hid in the parikrama.\n\nEvacuation continued\n\nWhile the security forces searched for the terrorists who were hiding in an alternative spot, they kept on evacuating visitors from the premises. The pilgrims present in the main Temple were escorted out at around 7:30 PM. Realizing there is no escape, the terrorists jumped out of the parikrama area and fired on the commandos.\n\nNSG called\n\nAt around 5:15 PM, then-CM Narendra Modi called Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani and asked for National Security Guards to manage the situation. At around 10:10 PM, NSG commandos reached Akshardham. At around 11:30 PM, they started the operation. The terrorists entered a bathroom to hide around midnight. By that time, several security agencies, including Rapid Action Force, Border Security Force, State Reserve police and Anti-Terrorist Squad, had reached the premises.\n\nTerrorists neutralized next day\n\nAs the sun started to rise, the terrorists became impatient and fired continuously on the security forces. At around 6:45 AM, the commandos managed to neutralize the terrorists who by then had moved into bushes close to Exhibition Hall 3.\n\nSeveral lives lost\n\n30 pilgrims, one state police officer, and one commando lost their lives during the attack. Another commando was seriously injured and died later in the hospital after fighting for his life for two years.\n\nReopening of Akshardham Temple\n\nOn 7th October 2002, the temple premises were reopened for the public. Several steps were taken by the temple administration and the state government to ensure improved safety measures.\n\nPOTA court convicted and sentenced the six accused but they were acquitted by the Supreme court in 2014 in lack of evidence. An absconding accused was arrested by ATS in 2019 from Jammu and Kashmir.",

    "text": "Social Media is awash with a viral claim that news agency ANI interviewed the same person for the recently passed farm bills and the demonetisation that the Modi government had ordered in 2016. Photos of two similar-looking man were shared by the national social media co-ordinator of Congress Vinay Kumar Dokania to allege that ANI sought views from the same man who lauded demonetisation in 2016 for the recently passed farm bills.\n\nINC social media co-ordinator shares a fake tweet of a farmer resembling a man ANI interviewed in 2016\n\nA tweet posted by Vinay Kumar Dokania, National co-ordinator of the social media for the Indian National Congress, instantly went viral in which he has alleged that a farmer who was recently interviewed by ANI had earlier worked with the news agency in 2016 for praising PM Modi after he announced demonetisation and Digital India initiative.\n\nFake tweet by INC social media co-ordinator\n\nThe claim was vigorously denied by Smita Prakash, the Editor-in-chief of ANI, who claimed that the pictures belonged to two different individuals and that Dokania was lying.\n\nHowever, the tweet\u2019s reach was amplified when Abhishek Dutt, the Vice President of Delhi Congress quoted Dokania\u2019s tweet, asking Smita Prakash if what the tweet asserted was true. The ANI Editor-in-chief responded that his colleague started the controversy with his fake tweet and his tweet amplified the fake tweet.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDutt shot back that he will get it removed as soon as possible if the tweet was fake. However, despite explicit clarification from Smita Prakash, the tweet has not been removed at the time of writing this article. Instead, the tweet has been widely shared on Twitter by ANI detractors, accusing the channel of planting respondents.\n\nSmita vigorously refutes allegations of ANI planting respondents to show the government in a good light\n\nAs the tweet started doing the rounds on the microblogging website, users also raised questions over the journalistic ethics followed by ANI. One of the Twitter user, Vaibhav Vishal, went so far as to claim that the farmer did not appear like a farmer because he was wearing a brand new scarf, vest and all. Vishal suggested Smita question her team because the man did not jibe with his perceived image of a rural farmer.\n\nSorry (not really) that a farmer, among the millions in this country, doesn\u2019t fit your Bollywoodian image of a starving emanciated kisan \u2014 Smita Prakash (@smitaprakash) September 22, 2020\n\nHowever, Smita took a jibe at the Twitter user, apologising that a man did not fit his image of a starving emaciated farmer.\n\nBut the rap on the knuckles did not deter Vishal from brazening out his stand. Sharing the images of farmers interviewed by the ANI, Vishal pontificated that ANI should introspect as the farmers donning new kurtas and super white vests give an appearance of fabrication.\n\nRead, Smita. READ (really). I am NOT saying the starving emaciated kisaan is the Bollywood kisaan. The fake gamchha-ganji combo makes the Bollywood kisaan. The farmers in ALL your pics look manufactured with their brand new kurtas and super white ganjis.\n\n\n\nIntrospect. Don\u2019t react. pic.twitter.com/qA7T04jP22 \u2014 Vaibhav Vishal (@ofnosurnamefame) September 22, 2020\n\nA war of words erupted after the fake tweet was shared by a veteran Army officer who sought an explanation or rebuttal from Smita Prakash about the fake allegations. A Twitter user responded to the tweet alleging that ANI is doing all it can for its masters but was caught red-handed. Mr Thapar replied saying that he could not understand how could people appear on TV debates as \u201ca guest, sanctimonious, holier than thou, preach ethics and call out people for their duplicity\u201d.\n\nYou are the one who is a copy paste artiste who doesn\u2019t know fact from fiction and accuse others without verification. The pix is not of the same person, Mister Thapar. \u2014 Smita Prakash (@smitaprakash) September 22, 2020\n\nTaking cognisance of this oblique remark, Smita Prakash slammed the veteran officer, calling him a \u201ccopy paste artiste\u201d who could not distinguish fact from fiction and accuse others without verification. Mr Thapar expressed his gratitude for the clarification issued by Ms Prakash but questioned her for her angst.\n\nYes. You called me \u2018sanctimonious\u2019 and other such things in your tweet. I can give it back just as good as I get. Since you apparently wore a uniform you should appreciate an adversary who will not be bullied. \u2014 Smita Prakash (@smitaprakash) September 22, 2020\n\nSmita responded, \u201cYes. You called me \u2018sanctimonious\u2019 and other such things in your tweet. I can give it back just as good as I get. Since you apparently wore a uniform you should appreciate an adversary who will not be bullied.\u201d\n\nHowever, Brig Sandy Thapar replied with another tweet, stating that his comment was on the general of state of affairs in the media and why did Smita Prakash took an \u201cudta teer\u2019. Mr Thapar further added that one should not take him for gullible fools who cannot make out affiliations/loyalties. He also said that channels being biased is acceptable but news agencies taking sides is \u201cdespicable\u201d.\n\nWho said anyone takes you for a fool? Your affiliations are very clear by reading your timeline. Your snide comment was directed at me and no \u2018udtaa teer\u2019 . You probably fired duds in your career and think civilians like me can\u2019t see what did. \u2014 Smita Prakash (@smitaprakash) September 22, 2020\n\nTo this tweet, Smita sharply retorted, noting that his affiliations are crystal clear by reading his timeline and that she could very well discern that his disparaging remark was directed at her.\n\nANI gets attacked while news agency PTI gets free pass\n\nWhile news agency ANI gets attacked time and again, mostly by propagandists who rush to accuse it of being a \u2018propaganda\u2019 outlet, they usually give another news agency, PTI, a free pass for misquoting leaders like PM Modi and even sharing fake images.\n\nIn August this year, PTI was found misquoting PM Modi on absolute number of coronavirus cases in India. Prior to that, in June, PTI interviewed Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong wherein he blamed India for the clash between the two countries at Galwan Valley. PTI received flak over the fact that its journalist did not bother to counter-question the Chinese ambassador on his dubious claims. People had also pointed out that the \u2018interview\u2019 came across as a press release by the Chinese Communist Party rather than a genuine interview.",

    "text": "Amidst the criticism against the ruling Shiv-Sena led Maharashtra government over its inability to limit the rising coronavirus cases in the state, the Uddhav Thackeray-led Sena has now resorted to a dangerous campaign to promote \u2018self-medication\u2019 in the state.\n\nWith cases rising in almost every corner of the state, the Shiv Sena seems to have shed its responsibility to provide health care facilities to the ailing patients in the state and has now started a new campaign \u2013 \u201cMy Family My Responsibility\u201d to inform the suspected coronavirus patients regarding the self-medications for the Chinese pandemic.\n\nOn Wednesday, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had launched the \u201cMy Family My Responsibility\u201d campaign in which the government would conduct a door-to-door survey for tracing and treating patients, identifying people with co-morbidities, raising awareness and educating the citizens on safety measures to break the transmission of the virus.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra has been the worst affected state in the country with more than 12 lakh people tested positive for the pandemic and more than 33,000 people have died due to coronavirus.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMeanwhile, an e-poster in the name of Shiv Sena leaders has gone viral on social media platforms, under which they are advising the coronavirus patients to take prescriptions suggested by the Shiv Sena leaders.\n\nImage Source: Dr Amol Annadate\n\nThe poster was shared by Twitter user Dr Amol Annadate to urge the Maharashtra CM to not promote self medication. Through this poster, which has WHO logo and pictures of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and other ministers, the Shiv Sena leaders advise the suspected coronavirus patients to take self-medication. The Shiv Sena leaders have prescribed Hydroxychloroquine, vitamin D, C and Zinc tablets for the symptomatic coronavirus patients.\n\nFor people with breathlessness, the campaign prescribes Dexona-5 mg and in case of fever, it advises to take Dolo 650 mg. Similarly, in case of throat pain \u2013 Cetirizine 10 mg and the drug Brozedex for patients who suffer from cough.\n\nThe detailed poster is being circulated by the Shiv Sena corporator Sujata Patekar and her husband Shiv Sena Vibhag Pramukh of Magathane Udesh Patekar.\n\nThe posters also ask people to have ayurvedic kadha, hot turmeric milk, hot water and immunity booster supplements under other \u201cessential guidelines\u201d.\n\nThe Shiv Sena leaders also urge people to maintain hygiene and social distancing while asking people to avoid smoking, alcohol and tobacco.\n\nIt is important to note that self mediation at the time of a pandemic could be dangerous and fatal for patients who may have other health complications. However, the Shiv Sena, in a shocking act of recklessness has now opted to give free advise to the people of Maharashtra to follow \u2018self-medication\u2019 procedures.",

    "text": "On the 127th anniversary of the famous address of Swami Vivekananda at the Parliament of World Religions in Chicago, let us look at another iconic speech of the 19th century Hindu saint. In a speech titled, \u201cThe great teachers of the world\u2019 delivered on February 3, 1900, at the Shakespeare Club in Pasadena in California, Swami Vivekananda talked about the significance of Messengers and their importance in the context of religion.\n\nMy Prophet is the only true Prophet is not correct, stated Swami Vivekananda\n\nIn his speech, the Hindu saint emphasised, \u201cNow, as regards those of you that think that you understand Truth and Divinity and God in only one Prophet in the world, and not in any other, naturally, the conclusion which I draw is that you do not understand Divinity in anybody; you have simply swallowed words and identified yourself with one sect, just as you would in party politics, as a matter of opinion; but that is no religion at all.\u201d\n\nSwami Vivekananda was of the belief that not a single Prophet could embody the \u2018Truth\u2019 of the world. Every Prophet had a task to fulfill in the world and that all Messengers together taught the message of God to the people. \u201cSo, when each man stands and says \u201cMy Prophet is the only true Prophet,\u201d he is not correct \u2014 he knows not the alpha of religion. Religion is neither talk, nor theory, nor intellectual consent. It is realisation in the heart of our hearts; it is touching God; it is feeling, realising that I am a spirit in relation with the Universal Spirit and all Its great manifestations,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cThis very moment let everyone of us make a staunch resolution: \u201cI will become a Prophet, I will become a messenger of Light, I will become a child of God, nay, I will become a God,\u201d he concluded.\n\nWe are bound to worship personalities, contrary to Islamic teachings\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Hindu saint added that while such Prophets had been worshipped and admired by every religion, Mohammedans (Muslims or followers of Mohammed) were different from the rest. But, he added that, as humans, we were bound to worship and revere individuals on a higher spiritual level that us. Swami Vivekananda said, \u201cThe Mohammedans from the beginning stood against any such worship. They would have nothing to do with worshipping the Prophets or the Messengers, or paying any homage to them; but, practically, instead of one Prophet, thousands upon thousands of saints are being worshipped. We cannot go against facts! We are bound to worship personalities, and it is good.\u201d\n\nSwami Vivekananda pointed out the dangers of sectarian beliefs of \u2018some\u2019 Muslims\n\nIn his speech, the Hindu monk emphasised, \u201cNow, some Mohammedans are the crudest in this respect, and the most sectarian. Their watchword is: \u2018There is one God, and Mohammed is His Prophet.\u2019\n\nHighlighting the dangerous implications of such a belief that had wrought havoc on the lives of disbelievers (Kuffars), Swami Vivekananda said, \u201cEverything beyond that (in Islam) not only is bad, but must be destroyed forthwith; at a moment\u2019s notice, every man or woman who does not exactly believe in that must be killed; everything that does not belong to this worship must be immediately broken; every book that teaches anything else must be burnt. From the Pacific to the Atlantic, for five hundred years blood ran all over the world. That is Mohammedanism!\u201d\n\nSwamiji was a visionary in the sense that the notion of killing every man or woman who didn\u2019t believe in Islam by some Muslims turned out to be true, years later in 2001. On this day, 19 years ago, Islamist terror outfit Al-Qaeda orchestrated four different terror attacks, hijacked planes, and killed 2977 people in the United States.\n\nThe Hindu saint believed in the notion of \u2018equality\u2019 in Islam\n\nSwami Vivekananda believed that Islam, though it spread through bloodshed, could not have survived the wheels of time if there was nothing good in it. He opined, \u201cHow could Mohammedanism have lived, had there been nothing good in its teaching? There is much good. Mohammed was the Prophet of equality, of the brotherhood of man, the brotherhood of all Mussulmans.\u201d\n\nHe stated that a lot could be learnt from the life of Prophet Mohammed. \u201cSo we see that each Prophet, each Messenger, has a particular message. When you first listen to that message, and then look at his life, you see his whole life stands explained, radiant,\u201d Swami Vivekananda stated.\n\nHe further added, \u201cMohammed by his life showed that amongst Mohammedans there should be perfect equality and brotherhood. There was no question of race, caste, creed, colour, or sex. The Sultan of Turkey may buy a Negro from the mart of Africa, and bring him in chains to Turkey; but should he become a Mohammedan and have sufficient merit and abilities, he might even marry the daughter of the Sultan.\u201d\n\nComparing it with the \u2018orthodoxy\u2019 of some Hindus, Swamiji clarified, \u201cNotwithstanding our grand philosophy, you note our weakness in practice; but there You see the greatness of the Mohammedan beyond other races, showing itself in equality, perfect equality regardless of race or colour.\u201d\n\nHowever, the great Hindu monk was unaware that years later, the notion of equality will turn out to be a farce. Sunnis will fight the Shias and vice-versa in Iraq and Saudi Arabia and vice-versa, Ahmadis will be deemed as non-Muslims and Hazaras will face persecution at the hands of Sunni \u2018brothers\u2019 in Pakistan.",
